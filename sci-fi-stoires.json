{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">I saw the court through Athena Washington's eyes. I felt a quiver in her lungs with each intake of breath. Her muscles ached for rest, but training and adrenaline kept them going. Her palms sweated as she bounced the ball.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The score was 101-99, with the Blue Birds trailing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The clock read 00:07.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">At least two billion people watched Athena. Most of them, like me, were brains in tanks somewhere in sprawling storage facilities, tuning in to the video stream. Fifty thousand or so flesh-and-blood fans filled the stands. Most of those spectators were children on furlough from the city's childcare center; minors could stay flesh-and-blood even if they were broke. The rest were upper-crust types who had kept up with the rising Physical Presence Fees, buying the right each year to inhabit their ageless bodies.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was not so fortunate. Like most people, without cash or credit for the first year's payment, I had gone into the tank on my eighteenth birthday. Still, I counted myself lucky in other ways. I had snagged all-season Follower rights to Athena early on, when the Blue Birds had been struggling and Athena still had those ankle problems. Forty minutes of game time each week was enough reality for me, but I had held out hope for this one moment all season long.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In Athena's peripheral vision, two of her teammates were open near the basket, but I knew she would save the shot for herself. I knew the game was ours.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I had faith in her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">00:06. I pushed those thoughts out of my mind, losing myself in the moment as much as I could. There would be time to tweet about it later.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">00:05. A yellow line of text flashed in the lower edge of my visual field.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>BID FOR MOTOR CONTROL ENTERED--$250,000  for 3 sec. by elite follower:  JoeSixPack.</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A quarter million. <i>Damn,</i> I thought. <i>JoeSixPack must have sponsors, or a hell of a day job.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">00:04. Athena feinted a pass. I could tell she was stalling while she mulled over the bid. A bid that large would pay off a chunk of her Physical Presence Fees and draw the attention of heavy-hitter sponsors. Taking a bid like that showed that she trusted her fans and that, to her, the game was about more than her own ego. The crowd liked that.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I would have turned down the bid if it had been up to me. What if the shot missed? I would have always wondered how things might have gone if I had taken the shot myself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For immortals, whether flesh-and-blood or in the tanks, \"always\" was a long time.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">00:03. The bid flickered green and a warning flashed. <b>BID ACCEPTED.</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hold on, everyone,\" said the announcer. \"We've got an amateur on the court.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Athena gripped the ball tightly and shuddered as JoeSixPack took control.  With a flick of Athena's wrists the ball was in the air. I felt JoeSixPack's anxiety as an unfocused tension in Athena's muscles until the ball bounced twice off the rim and dropped into the net.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There you have it, folks,\" said the announcer. \"A crowdsourced victory for the Blue Birds. We'll be seeing more of JoeSixPack, maybe even in the flesh next season. A shot like that could earn anybody a sponsor, even in the vats.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The buzzer sounded. Balloons and confetti dropped from the rafters and the crowd jumped to its feet before the ball had time to hit the hardwood.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The cheers and the reflected glow of Athena's pride sent a jolt through my brain. Last year, when Athena had made it to the playoffs, I had felt the same rush. This time, though, the feeling slipped away quickly. It wasn't enough just to watch anymore. JoeSixPack had been a part of the game, and what had I done? I was no better than the average vat-dweller.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Athena waved to the crowd and gazed out at them in a way that would look like poise and determination to the camera. In a few more seconds, the neural stream would have ended. Athena would have walked back to the locker room and I would have returned to the blogosphere, except...</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A girl in the third row waved to Athena. She wore her hair in tight braids and held a stuffed Blue Bird mascot under her arm. To me, she was just like the other fifty thousand fans, but I was watching through Athena's eyes. She called the shots.  My view of the crowd lurched as Athena met her gaze.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>That wasn't part of Athena's persona,</i> I thought.  Athena always had poise. In every other game that season, she had cast her eyes out over the crowd in a panoramic pan shot before walking off the court in cinematic serenity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Athena's chest tightened and her face flushed. She had gone off script, and she knew it, I thought. But why?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The girl in the third row was still a child, still flesh-and-blood. Her teeth were crooked, not the hallmark of a privileged upbringing. One day, she might head to a vat like me. Maybe all she needed was the right inspiration to follow in Athena's footsteps for a chance at real immortality. I had no access to Athena's inner thoughts, but I wondered if the girl reminded her of her younger self.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I thought back to Athena's bio. Her mother had given birth to her at age sixteen and had struggled to stay out of the tanks until she was nearly twenty. Athena must have remembered her mother as a living person, not just an avatar or an occasional ghostly presence in the caretaker android. If Athena had gone to the games as a spectator, she must have carried with her a sense of being alone, one that we vat-born brains could never really imagine.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Athena recovered from her lapse and became once more the paragon of athleticism that the sponsors wanted her to be. The twinge of tension faded away, blending into the hollowed-out ache in her muscles. I was sure the feeling that the pain would come back to her that night, or maybe in the offseason. She would never let it get to her, though. Like the twisted ankle, it was something to push through for the sake of the game.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I did not have Athena's dedication. I could not bear the thought of looking back on a championship game and wondering how it might have turned out. She could spend the rest of her life wishing for that moment back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For immortals like us, that was a long time.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Bidding was still open.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In my mind's eye, I glanced at the bidding display and willed a hundred-dollar bid for ten seconds to the top of the queue.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I felt a chill run down Athena's back as she pulled herself back mentally from the celebration.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's going on here,\" said the announcer. \"There's a post-game bid on the board. Is that legal? Someone fact check that for me. I mean, is that even possible?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I waited while the neural scanners plucked the response from her brain.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>BID ACCEPTED</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I had no clear plan in the instant my motor pathways engaged with Athena's nervous system. I was glad enough not to fall down. My first thought was just to get closer to the fan.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hold up,\" said Athena. \"There's one more thing I've got to do.\"  I recognized my voice transmuted through Athena's lungs and vocal cords. I thought back to my eighteenth birthday, when I still had a voice of my own. It had never resonated like that.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I walked past the other players, and they looked back at me, at Athena, with surprise or concern.

No big deal.  No one who'd grown up in that city of ladders and clock towers would ever fall because of a loose rung.  He finished the rest and secured it to the workshop doorway with a solid modified double hitch that wouldn't slip in a hundred years.  Then he climbed down to his waiting spider, fired up the engine, and drove down the city's webs to enjoy the evening.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Six months later, his uncle Shaln was climbing with a box of bolts and gears and other hardware balanced in his arms.

There it rested for days. The driver, one Beeshenai, followed his usual commute from his home out on the outer edges of the city to his work in the center, where the webs converged into a knot of spider traffic.  When Beeshenai was rushing to work one day and stuck on a slow-moving web, he chose to make a jolting jump across a wide gap to another web.  Mid-leap, the nut slipped down into the leg gears, and one leg, which should have lightly grabbed the new web, instead tore forcefully through several strands before catching.

Karl does not know this yet.  At the moment, he stands fidgeting in the chill white hall outside a classroom door, listening to the low voices of his thesis examiners percolate through the gap separating the door from the hallway's polymer tiles.  He is afraid of what they might be saying about him and the work he has done, but when they go silent, his fear only intensifies.  In that silence, it seems that his future has been determined, its pattern fixed and written in time by the old men in the classroom, these instructors to whom he has entrusted his fate.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">This prospect terrifies Karl.  His breathing is rapid and irregular, like his pulse, and sweat trickles down his back despite the chill air billowing from the vent down the hall.  He toys idly with the brown-striped collar of his cadet's uniform, stubby fingers twisting at the plastic tabs set into its fabric.  For a moment, he imagines the course his life will take if he has failed:  an unimportant desk job somewhere in the apparatus of the decaying Reich, perhaps accompanied by one of a dozen diseases he inherited from his inbred, eugenics-obsessed forebears.  He shudders at the thought and blots it from his mind.  Karl has never felt as helpless as this, as vulnerable to the cruelty of an impersonal universe.  He has been a non-determinist all his life, but now his faith is being tested, and it seems that his vaunted volition can avail him nothing.  His choices have all been made, as certainly as if they had been made for him, and now all he can do is wait for the verdict of time:  Pass or Fail?  Live or Die?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl closes his eyes and calms his breathing.  For him, there is only the present moment.  The past is immutable, and the future is a formless void.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In five seconds, the door will hiss open and Karl's advisor will give him the good news.  His eyes will open, and a smile will blossom on his lips, unfurling itself to reveal the chipped enamel of his teeth.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In three seconds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Two seconds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">One.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>T minus two centuries:</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Depending on who you ask, Karl's graduation is either three years ago or a hundred and ninety-seven years in the future.  Which is not to say that anyone in the bunker Karl is trapped in has any time to worry about the date.  The earthshaking impact of shells landing nearby has shaken a haze of dust and fungus into the air, and parents are busy covering their faces with damp cloths and pressing breath-masks onto their children.  Karl's team has been ordered to retrieve as many of the refugees filling the shelter as they can, but the job is proving difficult; the dialects of Thai and Cantonese which the OKZ's researchers had them learn are different enough from the pidgin these families speak that all their efforts so far have only coaxed one child through the pickup field and into their home century.  Karl sees the frustration written on Manni and Uta's faces through the haze of transparent green numbers his implant is feeding to his optic nerve.  They're cutting it close, staying down-time this long; after allowing for error, there are two minutes of safety left before an Imperial Japanese <i>Tanuki</i> shell will burrow its way through the steel plates and hardened concrete separating the bunker from the surface.  It will explode, and the dozen families who are staring at them and their vintage Thai Army uniforms with wide, fearful eyes will be reduced to a bloody jelly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But saving the life and genes of one child is not enough to justify the expense of flashing a recovery team this far down-time.  Karl knows that in his bones.  \"You have to come,\" he says in awkward Thai to the family nearest him, a mother and three breath-masked daughters all in loose cotton robes, huddling atop a plastic tarp held down by all their worldly possessions.  Again in Cantonese, this time beckoning with his hands:  \"You must come with us.\"  The mother's stare is glassy as another near miss shakes chips of concrete loose from the shelter's ceiling, and Karl knows with a sickening certainty that she is dead already.  She has given up, chosen to die in this tomb.  And she will, in exactly one minute and thirty-five seconds, plus whatever the safety margin is this time.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Please,\" Karl says, gesturing to the woman's daughters.  He makes his voice imperative and his gestures abrupt, trying to convey urgency with the sweep of his hands as they jerk towards his body.  \"Come on!\"  Out of the corner of his eye, Karl can see Manni and Uta trying similar tactics on other families.  Nothing is working.  Perhaps if the <i>Oberkommando der Zeitreise</i> hadn't guessed wrong as to the dialect these people would speak, something could have been done, but as Karl sees their time slipping away, the clock in his head relentlessly counting down to zero, he knows that things are hopeless.  No one else is going to come with them.  No one else is going to be saved.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"<i>Scheisse</i>,\" Manni snarls as the clock in Karl's head hits fifty-nine seconds left, and then he's gone, flashed back to the present without any regard for their mission or what will happen to the refugees.  A few children who were looking at him point and jabber something to their parents, but for the most part no one seems to care.  Everyone is too busy staring at the cracks growing in the ceiling, at the dust showering down as the seismic impact of ground-penetrating shells creeps ever closer.  A surge of anger at Manni's cowardice rises from Karl's stomach, searing the membranes at the back of his throat with acid.  Just because a situation is hopeless doesn't mean they can throw up their hands, say it was fated, and go home.  Their job is to make miracles happen; to save lives and genes from their ancestors' pogroms.  Karl has always made a point of staying with an operation until the safety circuits in his suit pull him out, and he's not going to give up on these people until they're dead and buried.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lurking at the back of Karl's mind is the knowledge that Manni is a determinist and an advocate of force.  To Manni, everything that happens down-time has already been set in stone:  his flashing home early isn't cowardice but destiny, while their failure is the inevitable result of the OKZ repudiating coercive tactics a quarter-century before.  If pressed for a response, Karl would argue that coercion was both unethical and ineffective, and that determinism is another form of fear, but at the moment he has no time for such thoughts:  the tallest of the dead woman's daughters has detached herself from her mother's hand and is walking towards him, her feet edging off the tarp as her sisters stare at her with wide eyes.  The clock in Karl's head flashes 0:00:35, and in the corner of his vision a sudden void tells him Uta has flashed home too, but he focuses on the moment, on the girl walking towards him and the pickup field.  <i>One more life,</i> he prays silently.  <i>Please, God; let me save just one more life.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come on,\" he says as he beckons the girl closer, hoping that his voice will keep her moving.  He focuses on the girl's solemn, narrow face, past the numbers flashing in his head, and smiles, trying to project welcome and safety as the ground lurches beneath his feet.  Tentatively, her eyes wide with hope and fear, the girl steps forward, only to be thrown to her knees by the shock of a nearby impact.  Karl lunges toward her, hooks his hands under her armpits and lifts her to her feet, propelling her towards the corridor that leads to the pickup field.  The clock behind his eyes hits 0:00:10.  Only four meters separate the child in his hands from safety.  But with ten seconds left to go, four meters seem like miles.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Two hundred years later, Karl will recall everything happening in slow motion.  He will recall the bloodless chill of his own fingers as they pressed against warm, crumpled cotton, the girl's seeming lightness as he half-pushed, half-carried her towards the field, and the way she twisted in his grip, her heel catching him on the side of his right knee.  He will remember the weightless feeling of falling as his knee gave out, how the numbers in his head seemed to turn a bloody vermilion as another shock came, this one closer still, bringing down a hail of jagged concrete from the ceiling and smashing the shelter's single electric lamp.  He will replay an eternity spent groveling in darkness, fumbling for the girl's hands, and his final attempt to drag her into the field, drawing on a reserve of strength he didn't know he possessed.  He will remember the shimmer of the field closing around him, and the moment of amazed gratitude he felt as the girl's hands wrapped tightly around his own, having succeeded against all odds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then the lights will come on in his memory, the recovery room coalescing around him, stark and white and empty, and Karl will see the girl's hands; the girl's hands and forearms, hanging limp and pale and dripping, severed along a curve sharper than the edge of any knife.  The sound of liquid spattering on the recovery room floor will fill Karl's ears, followed by that of his own voice, screaming.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then, mercifully, he will remember nothing at all.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>T minus 49 days:</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl's greatest objection to Frau Doktor Angela Nakayama is that she is not a real doctor, a medical doctor, with the arcane knowledge of the human body that would allow her to prescribe him drugs.  Instead, her twin doctorates are in psychology and temporal causation theory, making her one of five people in the world qualified to hold the position of Chief Counselor at Von Braun Paratemporal Base.  Though records list her as thirty-nine years old, her face is as smooth and unlined as that of a child.  The creases around her eyes and mouth appear only when she laughs, which is rarely, and the spill of her bobbed hair is a shimmering jet in the light of her office.  One of the images that fades in and out of the picture frame on her wall shows her smiling in the archaic garb of a doctor of sciences: stole, hood, and robe.  But today, slouching in her chair, she wears a <i>Sturmbannf\u00fchrer</i>'s uniform, and she is not smiling at all.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It wasn't your fault, Karl,\" she says.  \"The past is fixed.  When the archeological team excavated the shelter last year, they found a girl's skeleton that was missing its hands and portions of its forearms.  I've read your thesis; you know the Law of Conservation of Atrocity as well as I do.\"  She meets his gaze with such obvious sincerity that Karl is forced to look away.  \"If you hadn't tried to bring the girl through the field, someone else would have.  Or else there would have been some other reason why her skeleton was missing its hands.\"  She stops, staring at the rigidity of Karl's expression, and shakes her head.  Despair and exhaustion are written upon her face.  \"I'm not getting through to you, am I?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I am responsible,\" Karl replies.  \"It wasn't someone else who cut her hands off.  I did.  I tried to save her and I failed, and no amount of determinist hand waving is going to change the facts.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The look Dr. Nakayama favors him with is sad and more than a little pitying.  \"The past isn't a quantum indeterminacy experiment.  The insertion of a modern observer into an established time stream doesn't collapse possibilities into fixed form, because the stream already includes the observer.  Everything down-time from us has already happened.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're denying me any responsibility for my actions,\" Karl says, recognizing the direction of her reasoning from an endless series of class discussions and more emotional arguments that had echoed up and down the halls of the <i>Akademie</i>.  \"I shouldn't feel guilty, because I have no control over anything I do.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's not what I'm saying at all,\" Dr. Nakayama says, her voice gentle, but Karl still glares at her, disbelief written plainly on his face.  He will not surrender his principles for the sake of a clear conscience, will not admit that he might not be responsible for the maiming of a young girl a few seconds before her death.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He is guilty, and he refuses to be consoled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>T minus 31 days:</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Dr. Nakayama is teaching Karl to play Go.  Her set is worn, its folding board battered by decades of hard use, but Karl finds its scars endearing.  They play outside, beside the base's Koi pond, and Karl frowns as Nakayama frames one of his stones with three of hers, threatening to capture it on her next move.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I thought you said this was a game of choice,\" Karl says as he fills in the inevitable next move, defending his stone from being captured.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It is a game of choice,\" Dr. Nakayama replies, calmly placing her next stone on the far side of the board.  \"Where chess has been solved by computers, the early and middle stages of Go resist analysis through raw computing power.  Only the endgame is amenable to combinatorial analysis.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Then how can you force me to respond to your moves?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Dr. Nakayama pauses to gaze at Karl, her expression unreadable.  \"Do I force you to react?\" she asks.  \"Or do I force you to choose?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl stiffens as her gaze bores into him.  \"Do you call sacrificing a stone a choice?\" he asks, as he connects two groups of his stones, ensuring their safety.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I do,\" Dr. Nakayama replies.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She plays another stone, cutting off two of Karl's stones from each other, and as Karl studies the board, he sees that if he had made her move on his turn, he would have secured those stones instead of the group he saved.  Now he must decide which of the two will live and which will die.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You always have a choice, Karl,\" Dr. Nakayama says as he studies the board, searching for a way out of her net and finding none.  \"You can't control what it is, and you won't always like its consequences, but the choice is always there.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl does not respond for half a minute, as his eyes map out intersections and he plays out possibilities in his mind.  Finally, he moves to protect one of the two stones, abandoning the other stone as lost.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Good,\" Dr. Nakayama says.  \"You're learning.\"  She places another stone on the far side of the board, the click of ceramic on wood echoing off of the courtyard's walls.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>T minus 11 days:</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So when do I get a clean bill of health?\" Karl asks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Dr. Nakayama gazes at him without surprise or rancor; this is the third time Karl has asked her this in as many minutes.  \"When I think you're ready,\" she replies.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The two of them sit in her office, Dr. Nakayama relaxed, Karl tense and fidgeting.  The forced inactivity of the last month has worn on Karl's nerves, as half a dozen missions have been planned and executed without him.  He wants to get back to the action, to read Uta's reports and see how his team has been doing in his absence, to flash down-time and snatch lives and genes and knowledge from the jaws of the past.  And yet he is trapped in this room with Angela Nakayama, who watches and judges him with her cold black eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm ready now,\" Karl insists, though he knows it will avail him nothing.  Of late, Von Braun Para-Temporal has begun to seem like a circular labyrinth to him, with its maze of paths and corridors leading inexorably towards the same destination.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Dr. Nakayama dismisses Karl's protestation with a wave of her hand.  \"Have you ever thought about what it must be like to be rescued, Karl?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I took three different seminars on retrieval psychology at the Academy.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Dr. Nakayama continued as if Karl hadn't spoken.  \"Despite the Reichstag and the OKZ's complaints about low retrieval rates, what surprises me about our operations isn't how few people we rescue.  It's how many people are willing to follow a stranger into the pickup field.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl shrugs.  In his heart of hearts, he is convinced the drop-off in live retrievals is linked to his being shunted to the sidelines.  After a moment, he says, \"It's not so hard to understand.  People just want to be saved.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do they?\" Dr. Nakayama murmurs, giving Karl a meaningful look.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl flushes, recalling the dead-eyed mother and the girls clinging to her skirts.  \"They do,\" he insists, as if he can make the statement true through sheer force of will.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Even so,\" Dr. Nakayama says, \"their desire for rescue is no guarantee of them allowing us to save them.  Would you trust a stranger who said you had to come with them, with no further explanation?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl shifts uneasily in his seat.  \"The technology doesn't allow us to take any other approach,\" he says.  \"Not without coercion, and all it entails.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But what if it did?\" Dr. Nakayama asks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If it did,\" Karl said, drawing a deep breath, \"we would have to revise our approach and establish rapport with prospective targets ahead of time.  It's been discussed for years.  The problem is that our monitoring system is already straining the capacity of the base's reactor.  A longer-term approach would completely compromise officer safety.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mm,\" Dr. Nakayama says, touching the end of her pen to her lips.  Karl shies away from her gaze; there is something terrible and ancient about her eyes, a darkness that makes him think of the ocean's crushing depths, and Karl wonders how he ever thought of the doctor's face as childlike.  After a moment, Dr. Nakayama lowers the pen to her desk.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You may go,\" she says, and Karl retreats from her office, feeling her gaze upon him as he leaves.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>T minus 2 hours:</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl prowls through the halls of Von Braun Para-Temporal like a caged animal, tracing and retracing their convolutions as he broods.  The technicians and specialists he passes give him a wide berth, and Karl can tell from their expressions that they fear his misfortune may be contagious.  He plunges past them, looking ahead to the next intersection, the next choice.  Each turning point allows him to imagine that he can break free of the trap that holds him in its jaws, to imagine his career can still be salvaged.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The thought is a delusion, of course.  Manni has been promoted to take Karl's place, in spite of his performance record.  If Karl's reports had been heeded, it would have been Uta who was promoted to lead the team, but Karl suspects his opinions have become as discredited as he is.  Despite Dr. Nakayama's reassurances, he's been out of circulation too long, and <i>Brigadef\u00fchrer</i> Tarlenheim has taken the opportunity to push him aside.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl turns, strides forward, and turns again, trying to outrun his thoughts, his anger, his despair.  His serpentine path through the base carries him around Dr. Nakayama's office, avoiding the courtyards and the gardens that they frequented together, and so when he turns a corner and finds her waiting for him, it comes as a surprise.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What are you doing here?\" Karl asks her, struggling to retain his composure as he comes to a halt.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Looking for you,\" Dr. Nakayama replies, unperturbed by Karl's obvious anger.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why?\" Karl asks again.  \"To gloat?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" Dr. Nakayama replies, meeting Karl's gaze with her cool, dark eyes, and as she speaks, Karl realizes he believes her.  In that instant, his visions of Dr. Nakayama and Tarlenheim conspiring against him dissolve, leaving him without a target for the inchoate emotion churning in his gut.  His fists clench and unclench, his breathing becomes uneven, and after a few moments, Karl realizes that he is about to cry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Let it out,\" Dr. Nakayama tells him, placing her hand on his arm.  Karl shakes her off, but he is already weeping, rivulets of tears coursing their way down his cheeks.  A muffled sob escapes his lips, and as he leans his back against a nearby wall, he feels Dr. Nakayama patting his shoulder.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There are more important things than your career,\" Dr. Nakayama tells Karl as he struggles to compose himself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are there?\" Karl asks bitterly, but the reproach he reads in Dr. Nakayama's eyes makes him subside.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There are,\" she says.  \"So long as you're alive, you have hope.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As Dr. Nakayama speaks, her watch chirps an alarm, and a moment later the ground shifts beneath Karl's feet.  Karl clings to the wall behind him as the complex shakes and the lights flicker, irrationally convinced that the tremor is a response to Dr. Nakayama's claim, and that the whole world has come undone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What was that?\" he asks when the shaking stops, not really expecting an answer.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The geological survey made when the base was built was flawed,\" Dr. Nakayama murmurs.  \"There's an undiscovered fault system a dozen miles away, and Von Braun Para-Temporal wasn't built to withstand an earthquake.  That was a foreshock.  Everyone inside the base is going to die when the real quake hits.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl turns to gape at her, wanting to ask how she knows this, how she can be so certain, but even as he turns, he knows the answer.  All this time, Dr. Nakayama has been establishing rapport with her target.  She is here to retrieve him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why me?\" Karl asks, his voice almost inaudible.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Out of all the personnel assigned to Von Braun Para-Temporal, only two bodies were not recovered from the rubble.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Karl nods, understanding.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What about Angela Nakayama?\" he asks after a moment, meaning, <i>Did someone die so you could rescue me?</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"She died from leukemia at age twelve,\" Dr. Nakayama replies, and Karl cannot tell if she is lying.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Another tremor shakes the earth, and a moment after the corridor goes dark, the emergency lighting comes on, illuminating the world with a lurid orange glow.  Karl swallows, feeling lightheaded.  His panic feels faintly unreal, as if all of this is happening to someone else.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't have any choice, then,\" he says, forcing the words out as dust cascades from the ceiling and the ground shifts beneath his feet. \"I have to come with you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You always have a choice,\" Dr. Nakayama tells him as a pickup field blossoms behind her, unfolding itself in the air.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As Karl meets her gaze, he sees what she has risked for him, the years she has expended to bring him to this place, this single moment.  For her, this is the moment of truth, and yet the power of choice is still his.  He could elect not to go with her.  And yet, at the same time, Karl knows that he truly has no choice at all.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In five seconds, he will allow the woman he knows as Angela Nakayama to take his hand and lead him into the shimmer of the pickup field.  His hands will shake, and as the field devours the light of his native time, Karl will wonder how far into the future he is going, and what fresh tragedies have made <i>his</i> genome precious.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In three seconds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Two seconds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">One.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/alec-austin/volition", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">\"Which is more important, books or people?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The question was posed in jest, but over the years I had come increasingly to believe that if the librarian's veins were opened, ink would flow from them rather than blood. Even so, I did not expect him to answer as he did.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Books.\" The librarian held out the saucepan. \"More cocoa?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes, please.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We sat in the blessed silence provided by the museum's digital baffles, sipping from our mugs, while I waited to see what he had to show me. I had first met the librarian as an eight-year-old bibliophile whose most vivid childhood memories were of the local public library and the thrill of all those books waiting to be read. That boy had grown into a book collector, a hobby I pursued in the spare moments left over from my everyday duties as a minor government functionary.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Cocoa finished, the librarian led me past the empty desks of the Reading Room, past the silent counters where once librarians had checked out the less valuable books from the collection, to the holy sanctuary: the rare books room. To be precise, the rare books <i>rooms</i>. This was the British Library, after all. It needed more than one room for its rare books.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian indicated a new display cabinet that had been given a place of honour even among the assembled Gutenbergs and Caxtons, Kells and Opticks, and First and Second Folios.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The book lay open at page 1:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>Some of the evil of my tale may have been inherent in our circumstances. For years we lived anyhow with one another in the naked desert, under the indifferent heaven\u2026</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not,\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It is.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\" The librarian's face creased into the broadest of unexpected smiles.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Of the several holy grails of book collectors this was among the most sacred: the 1922 first edition of T.E. Lawrence's <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>, which he had privately printed at the Oxford University Press. There were only eight copies made; six were accounted for but now, it seemed, that number had gone up to seven.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Where on earth did you find it?\" I asked, when I was finally ready to take a break from inspecting it, gazing at it, and generally drinking in the wonder of it. I suppose a new mother must feel something similar when contemplating her first child.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It was here all along,\" said the librarian. \"Tucked away in one of the storerooms. It had somehow been labeled as an architectural treatise belonging to the collection of the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities, back in the days when Museum and Library shared premises. I only came across it by chance.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We both gazed at it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"To think,\" I said, \"you're probably the first person to touch the book after Lawrence himself.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And the dunderhead who thought it was a book on architecture,\" said the librarian. \"I suspect I know who that might have been\u2026.\" His face grew thoughtful as he contemplated the appropriate punishment for misfiling a book.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Looking at him, it occurred to me that he had hardly changed at all in the years I had known him: hair greying but remaining on the cusp of actual white, complexion as pale as the artificial light, thin face bisected by the half-moon glasses permanently resting on the tip of his nose. In fact, the librarian might have looked at home in a mortuary, striding between the cold slabs; I confess that I sometimes felt, as we walked the silent halls and corridors of the library, as if we were the pathologists of a lost literary culture.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Have you uploaded it yet?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian shook his head.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Remiss of me, I know, but I wanted to share my discovery first. I shall, as you say, upload it. Presently.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Interested scholars would then be able to inspect perfect three-dimensional copies of the book, while those more concerned to hold up one end of a dinner-party conversation could download neural inputs sufficient to inculcate a comfortable memory of having read the book, without the tiresome necessity of ever having to look at it. After all, with most literature people want to have read the book, not to actually read it. In our rushed and hurried world, neural inputs meant that you could read all the classics of the canon in an afternoon and still have time for dinner.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Still,\" I added, on my slow wending out of the library and back into the ordinary world, \"I'm sure that with a find like this there will be a few scholars who will want to see the actual book.\" I paused at the exit. \"What do you think?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian shook his head, the light reflecting on his glasses.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, I do not think they will come. Not even for this.\" He began to close the door, then stopped.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come back in a week,\" he said. \"I may have something to show you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Is it--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But the door had closed, cutting off my question. The librarian always showed me in and out of one of the side entrances meant for staff; the high halls of the public entrance remained open, and empty, like some undiscovered cave in a forgotten country.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I turned up my collar, engaged the digital baffles, closed my ears to the babble of information, and set off into the modern world.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A week later I was back, but not alone. A constant stream of people--most of them academics by the cut of their gowns--was going in and out of the main entrance. Where before the Great Hall had stood sepulchral and empty, now excited scholars disputed with each other or sent students off on errands, while what appeared to be a positive scrum was developing around the main information desk, on which was displayed a prominent sign pointing the way to the Lawrence display. Messages flashed up on boards on the walls and ceilings, directing interested parties to the life cycle of the weevil (second floor, row J, shelfmarks DX80130 DSC); the hypostasis of the Archons (third floor, row O, shelfmarks 412.978000 DSC); and kin relations among chavs (sub basement 4, row B, shelfmarks YK.2005.a.10262). The messages constantly changed, until I realized that they were the answers being given to the crowd of importunate scholars clustered around the main desk. And there, in the centre of the circle, surrounded by a team of junior assistants, was the librarian. He nodded towards me, spoke a few words to one of his acolytes, and released himself from the desk.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I gestured, encompassing the people, the bustle, the sheer life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's astonishing,\" I said. \"Extraordinary. What's happened?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In an unexpected gesture of intimacy, the librarian took my arm. I must confess that this took me by surprise: I didn't so much flinch as stiffen. But as warrant for the degree of his excitement, I do not believe the librarian even noticed. He led me across the Great Hall, shrugging off the frantic enquiries of desperate scholars, and piloted me through one of the doors marked \"Staff only.\" Peace and calm immediately descended.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Would you mind walking?\" asked the librarian. \"I do so fear that I shall be immediately accosted if we venture the lifts, but I would like to show you around on this day of all days.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We made our way up the stairs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You are not, I believe, a specialist in information theory.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not exactly, no. Spreadsheets I understand, what produces them I don't.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Then I shall have to make use of analogy,\" said the librarian. \"Consider your brain: at its core is the spinal cord and the primitive brain structures that we share with other chordates. These structures are the basis for all the achievements of the human mind, from Shakespeare's sonnets to David's Psalms to Mozart's music. But take away the sub-structure and--no Shakespeare. Now, there are some very primitive parts of the modern, interconnected world, parts that have been there from the beginning but have been all but forgotten as more elaborate networks were built on top. But there is one place where these old things are still recorded.\" The librarian stopped and turned to look down at me. I must confess I was grateful for the break, as the climb was proving longer than I had anticipated.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The library.\" The librarian resumed the climb, speaking over his shoulder. \"In fact, some of these texts have never been uploaded.\" He glanced back at me, smiling. \"Can you credit it? It was a relatively straightforward matter to find the information and then remove one of the key substructures. So, for today at least, any scholar attempting to access information will find an error message and a notice advising him to repair to his local public library.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">At last we arrived at the top of the staircase and paused at the door.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Let us quietly inspect the evidence of scholarly activity\u2026.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It was, perhaps, unfortunate that the librarian opened the door at the precise instant a researcher dropped the book he was extracting from the shelf. He dropped the book because he was trying to simultaneously answer his phone while not spilling his cup of coffee.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hey, thanks,\" said the scholar, as the librarian swooped in, a literary falcon, and swept the book from the floor. But his eyes widened as the librarian put the book back on the shelf.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I need that,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Give me your library card,\" said the librarian.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Taking the proffered card, the librarian first scrutinized the embedded picture for resemblance to its subject--since it had only been taken that morning little time had elapsed for variations between image and reality to develop. Then, producing a small pair of scissors from his pocket, the librarian proceeded to cut the membership card in two, taking particular delight in bisecting the picture.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But\u2026but\u2026\" stammered the researcher.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your membership is canceled. Kindly leave the building.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After opening and closing his mouth a few times as if to speak--the frown on the librarian's face sufficient each time to stop him--the scholar trudged towards the lifts.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And switch off your phone.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We didn't move until the lift doors closed. The librarian sent a message down to reception to tell them to escort the erstwhile reader from the premises. Thus, the librarian's previous good mood was blighted and we drank our cocoa in something approaching silence.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I hoped the book abuse we had seen would prove to be a solitary lapse, but sadly that was not the case. Descending the levels we came across multiple cases of unauthorized eating and drinking. We heard many an illicit conversation, both local and by phone. There were a distressing number of cases of ABH (actual biblio harm) such as page corners being turned over and books being returned to the wrong shelves; and a few truly worrying instances of GBH (grievous biblion harm), where poor, innocent volumes had notes written on their margins or were left paralyzed with their spines broken. This last was a particularly sad case. We found <i>The Principles of Lingerie</i> by Reginald Spode lying abandoned on a desk, its spine cracked, its contents exposed, and with numerous marginal marks sullying its virginal purity. Of the malefactor there was no sign beyond a crumpled sweet wrapper.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Faced with this outrage, the librarian then did something truly extraordinary. The Spode, of course, should have been taken for immediate repair but we had other urgent tasks to attend to. So, rather than expose the book to further abuse, the librarian deliberately mis-shelved it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was shocked. But then, as realization dawned of the scope of the librarian's sacrifice, surprise turned into admiration.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Truly, it is a greater thing you do today\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But the librarian indicated silence. It was a library, after all. Not that you could have told that from the behaviour of most of the readers: everywhere we went there was the constant background noise of conversations, modulated by the mastication of many jaws. It would seem that today's scholar is unable to engage brain without first starting jaw.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Business appointments had claim of me for the rest of the day, so I left the librarian to battle against the waves of human fecklessness he was facing, but I called just before the library closed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian answered in sound mode. I supposed after such a day I would prefer not to appear on any screens either.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How has the day gone?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Even through the phone, the librarian sounded tired.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It only grows longer. It appears that many books have been replaced wrongly, so I fear I have many hours work ahead rearranging the shelves.\" Despite the lack of vision I could all but see the librarian shaking his head. \"It was never like this in Alexandria.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Would you like me to help?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, no thank you. I'm sure we can man-- excuse me, sir, that book's not for loan\u2026.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The line went dead.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The next week, after work as was my wont, I went to the library while it was still open. The news had been on little else but the loss of the country's academic data retrieval, so it was little surprise that the queue applying to be readers was even longer than before. Passing the desk area where applications were processed, I realized that it would only get longer. Last week, in the librarian's enthusiasm for these new readers, the desk had been manned by all his brightest and quickest staff. Today, there was just one, rather decrepit, librarian on duty, hard of hearing and long-sighted to boot.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The chief librarian, however, was not in his office, nor could I find him in the still-crowded halls and reading rooms, an exploration much distracted by the evidence before me of rampant book abuse. By the time I returned to the Great Hall I was all but trembling from the dreadful things I had seen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">This was where the librarian's messenger eventually found me. I was taken down through all the levels of the library to its basement. There I found the librarian, and went to him, arms outstretched.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My dear friend, how can you bear it?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian paused in his work. \"Ah, I am glad for your words. Sometimes I think I am just an old bachelor, grown set in his ways, unable to adjust to modern times. But you agree: this behaviour is outrageous. It cannot go on.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are you going to reconnect the library to the network?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian shook his head, somewhat ruefully. \"Would that it were that easy. It appears that no repair is possible. Of course, in the end outside agencies will trace the fault and rectify it, but time is of the essence here. If action is not taken soon, some books will be damaged beyond repair. As an all-but-forgotten writer of the twentieth century said: 'I accept the risk of damnation. The Lord will absolve me, because He knows I acted for His glory. My duty was to protect the library.' Or, as an even more obscure author remarked, if you will pardon the infelicity and paraphrase: I am one of the secret masters of the world. I am a librarian. I control information. Don't ever piss me off.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The librarian stood up.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come,\" he said, \"let us go and see.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We emerged from the lift and went out on the roof terrace.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Looking down, far down, I could see a constant stream of librarians loading books into the back of a fleet of lorries.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Where are they taking the books?\" I asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A library is ideal in secure times as a place for scholars to study. But what about in less certain ages? History teaches us that even the greatest collections may fall victim to the ignorant mob, if they are not guarded. We have, far from here, made provisions for the safety of these books. Another library, but one that is safe, secure and, most important of all, secret. And that is where I am taking the books.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I watched as the last of the lorries drove away, disappearing into the twilight. We stood in silence as night drew in over the city. Far below, the library had closed its doors. The librarian was waiting for something, although I did not know what that might be.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then, one by one, without any fuss, the lights went out. An unnatural quiet began to spread across the city as the darkness spread.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's happening?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do you remember asking me which was more important: books or people? Of course, my answer was rather playful, but nonetheless I was becoming increasingly concerned about the divergence between this current civilization and all that books represent: story, knowledge, art, law, science. The events of the last few days have decided me. If even scholars cannot be trusted with books, then this society can no longer be called civilized. Therefore, it is time to start again.\" He gestured towards the spreading pool of darkness, out of which increasingly feral howls and screams were already spilling. \"If you know what to do, a complex mechanism is easy to destroy. Many things can be found in old, forgotten books.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But, but they'll fix it, they'll find what you've done and repair it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It is not that easy, my friend. Processes have been set in motion that cannot be stopped. Come, it's time to depart, although,\" and at this point the wave of failing power took away the library's own light and electricity, \"I fear we will have to use the staircase.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The last I saw of my one-time friend was him climbing into the last lorry to leave the library and driving off into the darkness.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I write this now, by candlelight, some months later (I'm afraid I have lost track of the exact date). I will seal my testimony in a bottle and place it in what remains of the library (the mob destroyed much of the building some weeks ago even though they found there neither food or fuel). If, someday, my old friend emerges from his sanctuary with the books to start a new civilization I hope my record might be found: a short account of the end of the world.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/edoardo-albert/the-last-librarian", "title": null},

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Clarke stood on the dunes, watching the party coalesce on the beach. Over the horizon, and the grey swell of the ocean, lay Africa. Beyond their borders. Outside. Lands of suffering. A knot formed in his stomach just at the thought. He shifted his focus, tried to relax, and scanned the crowd for the familiar gait of his brother, longing to catch a glimpse of his face, but from a distance he couldn't quite resolve the features of the crowd. The wind blew hard off the sea, flicking his hair around his eyes and making the task more difficult. The exhibits, consumer products whose trails constituted art, stood on pedestals on the beach, the crowds floating between them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You've not really entered into the spirit of things, have you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" Clarke turned to see a woman beside him, short red hair, mesmerizing green eyes and the clothes of a high-chic traveller.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your trail,\" said the woman, flashing a screen in front of Clarke. The screen glowed with a map of the EU, darkness beyond its borders, a red line highlighted Clarke's journey; a journey of directness, from England to Portugal, no meandering, no detours, just purpose.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman smiled. \"I'm Anna.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke nodded and smiled quickly, returning his gaze to the crowd.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It would be polite to check out my trail, filter by last month.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Pardon?\" Clarke turned back to her, unable to suppress his annoyance. She tutted and flicked some buttons at the screen's edge, then pushed it back into Clarke's view. A red trail looped across the EU in the shape of a stylised daisy, its stem ending at their current position. Clarke raised his eyebrows in surprise. Anna laughed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You should see the trail for that tin of baked beans.\" She nodded towards the pedestals on the beach, and then looked him up and down with a frown.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's your name?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Clarke.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"First time at a trail-art party?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm not here for the party, I'm here to find my brother.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh,\" said Anna, \"well you'll never see him from up here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anna loped down the dune in long falling steps, her feet sinking into the soft, dry sand. When she reached the bottom, she turned back to face Clarke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come on.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke squinted at the faces in the crowd once more. Finally, he accepted her analysis and headed down the dune.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Drifting through the crowds Clarke watched the passing faces, hoping for a moment of recognition.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Look at this one,\" said Anna. They stood next to a microwave meal on a pedestal; her screen showed its trail, a huge danger sign scrawled across Europe. \"Twenty-three people have carried it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Huh,\" said Clarke, then quickly looked up again at the crowd washing past him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're sure eager to find your brother.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke nodded, \"I haven't seen him for over a year.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The feedback whine of a retro megaphone cut through the chatter and the wind, causing the crowd to turn and face the solitary figure at the sea's edge.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Time for journey's end,\" said the figure. The crowd cheered and converged on the pedestals, hoisting the products high into the air and carrying them towards the sea.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come on,\" said Anna, dragging Clarke towards the water.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No way,\" said Clarke, \"this is crazy.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's the end of the trail,\" shouted Anna.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke slipped his hand out of Anna's and pulled away.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" said Clarke, but the crowd swarmed by and swept towards the water. He tried to fight a path back towards the dunes in vain, as the crush of bodies enveloped him. He stumbled, stepped into the water as he regained his balance, and then, before he knew it, he was waist deep in the sea. The pressure of the crowd ceased. They stood, bobbing up and down with glee as the waves rushed past.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Out ahead, in the sea, the products were lifted up: a tin of baked beans, a microwave meal, a book, an iPod and more; held aloft like sacrifices.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Five!\" cried the megaphone. \"Four! Three! Two!\" The crowd cheered, driven to a frenzy by the countdown. \"One!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The products were thrown, looping out high into the sky. Clarke felt a quick sharp stab of pain in his head and heard a buzz that flashed through his body. Then the grey sea swallowed up its offerings.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke sat at the peak of a dune, drying in the breeze as he watched the party dissolve. He hadn't seen his brother. He pulled his screen out of his trouser pocket and flicked it to remove the excess water. The map was focused on his current position, the edge of the EU, one year ago. The trail in red was his brother's, blazing out into the sea and vanishing. Clarke sighed and flicked the time setting back to current, hoping for a miracle, hoping to spot his brother's trail amidst the departing crowd. He expected to see a streak of trails radiating away from the party and back into the mainland. Instead he saw nothing. No trails. He double-checked the screen. Shook it. Nothing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Damn thing's broken,\" said Clarke as Anna sat down beside him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh? How come?\" She was wet from head to toe, her clothes clinging to her like a second skin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I can't see anyone else's trails.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Of course,\" said Anna with a confused smile.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do you mean?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, we all got zapped, along with the products. Didn't you feel the EMP?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sorry?\" Clarke mumbled in shock, his head feeling woozy and thick.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You didn't know?\" said Anna.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Tell me!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're free Clarke. Trail-less. That's what these parties are all about. Art. Not just the products but us too. We journey our way here across Europe, to the edge of civilization, scrawling our final trail, and then it ends. Welcome to the invisible population of Europe.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But how will we survive?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Adapt,\" said Anna. \"Remember how we used to live. Before everything opened up automatically for us. Before we could watch our groceries being delivered on a map.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You mean living like savages? You might as well leave the EU, live in Africa.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, Clarke, we can live here and have the best of both worlds: security, prosperity and freedom.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But... We won't be able to...\" Clarke paused as realization rose through him like dawn, slowly and gloriously. \"My brother was here a year ago. His trail stopped there in the sea.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just like ours,\" said Anna smiling.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That means he's probably still alive?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Tears rolled down Clarke's face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm going to the authorities,\" said Clarke, \"to tell them that somebody zapped my trail transmitter.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are you crazy?\" said Anna. \"They'll just throw you into one of the camps.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, surely they'll just reinstate it. They want us to have trails.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah, right. They'll treat you as an illegal immigrant. Lock you up in a holding camp, and never let you go, under the pretence of awaiting deportation.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And then, who knows what.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But I need my trail,\" said Clarke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You don't,\" said Anna, \"you can learn to live outside of the system.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't want to!\" shouted Clarke. \"I don't care about your stupid art and ideals. I just want to find my brother. And now, without my trail, without net access, without access to transport... I'll never do it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anna frowned, then hugged Clarke. He let her, feeling, for a moment, safe. Then he pulled away and stared at his screen, flicking slowly through the last few months of his brother's trail. The trail wound across the EU, it appeared too methodical to be random and yet Clarke couldn't interpret any symbols.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Change the time frame,\" said Anna, peering over at the screen. \"Try weekly.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The jumble of red lines suddenly thinned and resolved to a clear circle.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And the next week,\" said Anna.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's a U and the week after is a T. Out. And then an arrow pointing here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Nice,\" said Anna nodding appreciatively. \"Great last trail. Out indeed. Out and free.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You think?\" said Clarke puzzled. Something nagged at him, something at the edge of his mind. Something that was disturbed by the thudding of a helicopter and the wail of a siren. Anna and Clarke stood to watch the helicopter pass over them. As they turned away from the sea they saw soldiers emerge from the pine forest that grew up to the dunes like a blanket. The soldiers were difficult to see, their camouflage causing Clarke's eyes to slip off. The effect was as if the forest was closing in on them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh no,\" said Anna.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke began to edge backwards towards the sea, searching for a way past the advancing horde.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It can't be for us,\" said Clarke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's the party,\" said Anna, her voice panicked. \"They've noticed all of our trails turning off. We should have left quicker. Shit. Why did I stay with you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They wouldn't do all this.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Wanna bet?\" They'll do anything to prevent trail-less, untraceable citizens.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Stop panicking,\" said Clarke.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We should be panicking. I don't want my freedom taken from me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Another helicopter swooped past them, black and angular like an ancient aerial monster. Clarke watched it, waiting for the instructions, but there was nothing except the noise of the rotors. Further down the beach, soldiers overwhelmed another straggler from the party. They pulled him away with minimum effort, not even bothering to speak, treating the person like another piece of flotsam washed up on the beach.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anna cried, sobs wracking her body. \"I just wanted to live free, in the EU.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke felt calm. He turned to face the sea, searching for Africa. He glanced down at his screen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Out,\" said Clarke. He glanced back at the soldiers; there was no way past them. \"Out of the EU.\" He grabbed Anna's hand and pulled her towards the sea. \"We have to swim. To Africa. That's where my brother went.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" said Anna, \"you're crazy. How will we survive in Africa? Live off the dust? Join a militia? Live like an animal?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can't wait here to be arrested,\" said Clarke, \"and imprisoned, maybe forever. Let's get out on our own terms.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anna pulled away and sank to her knees on the sand. Clarke paused for a moment and then he sprinted into the water, wading out until the waves were washing up to his waist. A loud wail caused him to look back to the beach. Soldiers dragged Anna away as she kicked and cried. Clarke felt a sharp jolt of guilt and lurched for a moment towards her. The he let the guilt fade, as he saw a line of soldiers across the beach. He thought of his brother. He dived into the sea and swam.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Clarke woke in a clean, white room, lit by sunlight pouring through the large window, his last memory being dragged out of the sea and into a small boat. He rolled off the bed gingerly, expecting his muscles to ache, but he felt fine, refreshed and full of energy. He walked out of the room into a walled courtyard overflowing with exotic plants. Then out onto a bustling street. The buildings seemed to grow out of the ground and wind their way into the sky. Happy faces drifted past, nodding their heads in a hello or shaking his hand in a welcome. A girl gave him a melon to eat, her smile infectious. She laughed at Clarke's confused expression.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He followed the street to its end, a park that overlooked the sea. The grass of the park was green and lush, large palm trees dotted throughout the lawn provided shade. And there, standing in a crowd, talking, his brother. He saw Clarke and sprinted towards him, enveloping him in a huge hug.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're awake,\" said Luke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I can't believe it's you,\" said Clarke. \"I've been so worried. I thought that you were dead.\" Clarke began to cry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hey, it's okay,\" said Luke, holding Clarke tight. \"You made it. You're free.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't understand,\" said Clarke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They lied to us,\" said Luke. \"Look around. This is Africa.\" Luke waved his arms towards the city.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Instinctively Clarke reached for his screen to check his trail and the trails of those around him. Then he realized that he didn't have his screen with him. And he no longer had a trail. And he smiled, and hugged his brother.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/james-bloomer/trails", "title": null},

He charmed me when I was young and stupid, but he proved insubstantial and unserious.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">This was a face that he feared--a face he saw when I came home to find he had lost another job. I wasn't sure where he was now, but at least he wasn't in my house, making a fool out of me every day.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I buy a potato and lamb curry on the way home and lay out two portions on the kitchen table for dinner. But the house is dark and quiet, and the message light flashes on the phone. Listening to the voicemail, I hear only my own voice. Nothing from Njoki.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When I finish my dinner, I throw Njoki's in the garbage. Stepping outside, I look up at the sky. It's dark now--the radiation warning long since passed with the setting of the sun. The aurora equatalis shimmer in the sky above Nairobi, green-blue curtains of wispy light high above the city, a testament to just how weak the magnetic field has grown.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There are no true poles anymore at all now--no north pole and no south pole. Instead, they flip and change from day to day. Sometimes there are temporary shifting holes in the magnetic field, multiple poles sliding across the face of the globe, six or eight or more at a time. Compass needles are no longer to be relied upon, when the field is strong enough for them to work at all. We'll live through it, certainly, but for now it's chaos.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I go back inside the house and consider calling Marian's parents, or the parents of Njoki's other friends. But I cannot imagine asking any of them if they have seen my daughter. What they would think of me--how foolish I would look then. And if Njoki were with any of them, she would call. No, this is more than the usual teenaged thoughtlessness. Whether Njoki knows it or not, this is an act of secession.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then suddenly I am in her bedroom. I don't recall making a decision or having any clear thought, but I am pulling clothes out of her closet and hurling them down the stairs to the hall below. I look around her room to see what she owns, but that is all there is. Clothes, clothes, clothes--and piles of shoes. I shovel the shoes into plastic garbage bags and haul them downstairs as well. I sit down angrily in the living room among Njoki's possessions and stare at the creeping hands of the grandfather clock.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After an hour, I feel almost foolish. Njoki thinks she is a woman--I know that. But equally, I know she is not one, not yet. Do I need to prove it to her like this? She's proud, like me. Do I need to break her pride in order to win her obedience? Sheepishly, I carry her clothes and shoes back up to her room again. I put the hangers back in the closet and pile the shoes underneath. But in the living room once more, there is still nothing to do but watch the hands of the clock.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then the door clicks open and Njoki creeps into the darkened hallway. I stand and look at her, and a ray of pale moonlight falls across her face. I'm shocked by the change from this morning--not just the dried tears and smudged make-up, but utter youngness of her face. Somehow she has been transformed into almost a child before me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Seeing me, she drops her handbag with a low cry, and then comes forward and clutches me in a tight hug. I'm bewildered and staggered, and all I can do is press her back. Where is the willful, scornful woman of this morning? Where did this clinging, sighing child come from? Another time, I might be ashamed of such total regression--but now I can only feel the painful beating of my own heart in my tightening chest.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I know, of course, the answer to the riddle. Njoki said it herself that morning--she is sixteen. As I hold her, I only hope, for both our sakes, that these changes and these reversals will take something less than a thousand years to complete.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/m-bennardo/reversals", "title": null},

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Joseph has an appointment with a brain scanner. On the appointed day, he trims his hair, as well as the nails on his hands and his toes.  He wears new underwear.  Freshly pressed pants and shirt.  Casual but decent shoes.  He aims to look ordinary but needs to be clean.  He aims to look highly functional, like he would never be bug crazy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Gee.  Avoid looking dysfunctional!\" his little voice says, laughing at him.  \"Never look like you hear voices.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We've made it out of there every time so far,\" says the deep voice.  \"Just be confident, show some attitude, like you have nothing to hide.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The Healthy Living Center takes up an entire building just across Volunteer Park.  Deviants and Partisans become healthy members of society there, but Joseph needs to hear his voices.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Hence, he must blend in on every level.  He knows that exercise will settle his factory-creased clothing into a more relaxed and natural appearance, and that the surveillance machines have algorithms to check; the scanners scan much more than just his neurons.  He needs to look just rumpled enough, just casual enough in a respectable way, and feels clever that he knows this.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're really thinking today!\" the little voice laughs.  \"Wow, are you clever!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Pipe down,\" says the deep voice.  \"We're playing for big stakes here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Like survival,\" Joseph says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't move your lips,\" says the female voice.  \"There's cameras.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joseph has heard that all people talk to themselves now and then.  Perhaps they do, but only one voice lives inside a normal head, and if more than one is detected, the scan shows an abnormality.  When an abnormality crops up, the scanner turns into a neural pulse generator, pops those bubbles of personality until something barely resembling Joseph remains.  He cannot sit back and allow himself to be mutilated.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Admit it,\" says the female.  \"You'd enjoy our company even if you didn't need us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But we're useful, not like the voices of the true schizophrenic,\" the deep one says.  \"We tell you profound secrets.  We have an ability.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just give us a trip to Vegas, and we'll prove it,\" says the little one.  \"We'll bring you big winnings.  Plus girls, girls, girls!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's disgusting,\" says the female voice.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The little voice snickers, while Joseph fears his doom more than ever.  With voices as crazy as these, he stands no chance of getting out of the Healthy Living Center in one piece.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"One piece?\" hoots the little voice.  \"Schizophrenia, from the German <i>skhizein</i>, to split.  The last thing you want is to get out in one piece.  That's the point, right?  To keep yourself split?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Why would the little voice think this is hilarious?  Why would the little voice associate this with schizophrenia, instead of a necessary adaptation for survival?  Joseph crosses the street, intending to walk through the park.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, no!\" shouts the female voice.  \"Don't cut through the park!  Call a car.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" Joseph says aloud.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But he does it.  He pulls out his handy.  He swipes the icon for a cab, and waits.  When the female voice speaks, he always listens.  That voice has saved him more than once.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How come you don't name us?\" says the little one.  \"I'd love to have my own being.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How come you think of us as mere voices, instead of several people sharing a single body?\" says the deep one.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Schizophrenia is a disease, but we're an asset,\" says the female.  \"We can't be a disease if we're a benefit.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joseph admits that he needs his abnormality, but clings to certain standards.  Multiple voices, each expressing original insights, are far different from multiple people trying to take over his skull.  Giving the voices names would approach insanity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The car arrives, and he gets in.  He barely joins the traffic before the horror starts.  He hears the first screams through the closed window of the cab.  Even normal people feel the terror now, during a harvest.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"See it fading?\" the female voice says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He tries not to, but he watches.  At first the trees in the park shimmer a little, then lose color, and finally most of their summer sunlight.  People try to escape it.  Soon nothing more than twilight remains.  Instead of a green, sunny park, he sees a gray, park-sized, cosmic chimney towering all the way into space.  People lucky enough to have gotten out before the gray closed in dart away from the edge of it.  A few run right into the traffic, causing all the cabs to screech, including his.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As always, one or two people move too quickly, even for the computerized cabs.  Medical bots come to gather up these broken and bleeding ones.  Given the quality of care at the Healthy Living Centers, they have a strong chance of complete recovery, at least from their broken bones.  Pity the ones who fail the brain scans, however.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Pity them, but not as much as those stuck inside the park.  Those inside disappear forever, harvested for something, something nobody understands.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"PANIC IS NEVER PRODUCTIVE,\" booms the alien voice from the fading park.  \"PLEASE MOVE IN A CALM AND ORDERLY FASHION.  THANK YOU.  WE ARE HERE FOR YOUR PROTECTION.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">By now the medical bots have marked the space they need to do their work, so the cabs detour around and resume their progress.  Joseph arrives a mere ten minutes late for his appointment.  He collects his thoughts, and puts on his attitude.  A just-bad-enough attitude is the best disguise, or so he hears.  It adjusts the mind into a pattern that disguises the voices.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Now inside his attitude, he feels his voices retreat into his subconscious.  Even the little voice takes this seriously.  He walks up to the receptionist, and the scanner lowers over his head.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What is the reason for your delay?\" asks the receptionist.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Healthy Living Centers always employ human receptionists.  This one speaks in a flat tone, and one side of her mouth sags in paralysis.  Joseph knows that they gave her this job because she failed the scan.  They popped the bubbles of her personality.  Her position provides her with job therapy, and her half-paralyzed face often causes the person under the scanner to panic and blow his cover.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your delay?\" the receptionist repeats more loudly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Traffic,\" Joseph says.  \"There were accidents because of the harvesting.  Or maybe you didn't notice.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The receptionist's good eyebrow goes up, and she clears her throat nervously.  Joseph waits while stretchers carrying the accident victims enter the clinic behind him, knowing that coming out and calling what just happened a \"harvesting\" borders on illegal.  Maybe he overdid it, but in his bad attitude he feels no regret.  Already, the scanner hums overhead.  In a moment it beeps.  Done just like that.  The receptionist squints at the display.  Joseph struggles to keep his anger at the top of his thoughts.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The receptionist shrugs, and looks up:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're still pre-schizophrenic, but your numbers are much better.  We'll still want you back again next week.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Whatever,\" Joseph says with a practiced sneer.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your attitude is inappropriate.  The wounded will be treated.  We're here for your protection.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joseph refuses to dignify this with a reply.  He pivots, and struts away.  A flaw in his angry manner might get him scanned all over again, right here and now.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But he makes it to the exit.  Safe for another week.  He passed!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Outside, sunshine glows over the green of the park.  The paved promenades and cobbled paths remain empty of humanity, punctuated by nothing more than a couple of bots chasing odd bits of blowing paper.  He feels someone come up to him at the same time that his voices come out of hiding.  A person follows a step behind his left shoulder.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This one's safe,\" whispers his female voice.  \"You can look at her.  She's one of us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He looks.  The woman comes up next to him, and takes his hand. She squeezes it in a secret pattern.  He replies with the secret answer squeeze, his middle finger pressing into her palm.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A little voice tells me we could talk,\" the woman says.  \"I know somewhere private.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Somewhere we can relax?\" says Joseph.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They turn and walk.  Joseph's voices keep silent watch, but he can feel them as certainly as he feels the alien ship overhead, still busy processing its harvest.  He knows some who have the voices who can pass the scan as normal.  He strives toward that goal himself. His improving numbers hint toward maybe next week.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just up here,\" the woman says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She shifts a little, and moves into him so that they walk arm-in-arm.  A feeling of trust bathes him like warm sunlight, here in this little pocket of freedom between them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The Partisans can never meet in more than pairs, but Joseph and this woman will go to a room and make love.  The intimate contact will allow their voices to exchange news, instructions, and marching orders.  He can taste her presence in his mind even as they walk.  Six voices live in her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I missed you,\" she says loudly, as they walk under a surveillance pod.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He has never seen her before in his life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do you think you're insane?\" the female voice asks him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He thinks so less and less, but nothing has been proven.  Doubt lingers.  He would risk everything to prove his sanity one way or the other.  His voices have something to say about that.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Even the Resistance?  You'd risk everyone in the Resistance?\" suggests the little voice.  \"How far would you go?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Risking everything would prove you're crazy, all right,\" the deep voice says.  \"Risking the one thing every human cares about?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A paradox,\" says the little voice.  \"You have to be crazy to prove you're not crazy.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm no good to anyone if I'm crazy,\" Joseph accidentally says out loud.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman under his arm flinches.  She stops all of a sudden, but she holds onto him.  Speaking aloud compounded with mentioning insanity makes for a serious security violation.  She looks into his face, his eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I have an appointment,\" she says.  \"Meet me later.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He expects her to break away from him, but she kisses him first, hard and long and open-mouthed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"See you then,\" she says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't ask her where,\" says the female voice.  \"Whatever you do, for once keep your mouth shut.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He must close it first.  He stands in front of a fast food window.  The closest door should be locked, but he tries it intuitively.  Somehow he knows he must go through it.  It opens.  He wonders how he knew.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The kiss,\" the deep voice says.  \"Intimate contact is how we communicate.  Remember?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The door opened when it never should have, so he feels sane enough to follow the impulse to walk straight through the kitchen, go into a closed closet, then out the door on the other side, and down a stairway.  He follows a corridor, turns left, and climbs another stairway.  It leads to a single door, but this one is locked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"See the wires up there?\" says the deep voice.  \"Pinch them together.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When he pinches them, a small spark stings his fingers, but he also hears a click.  He pushes, and the door opens.  He steps out, and finds himself in the country.  He still holds the door, which exits from the wall of an enormous steel building.  He never entered a steel building, and wonders about that.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If you let it close, you leave here forever,\" says the female voice.  \"If you wedge that rock in it, you might be able to go back.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Even a schizophrenic understands the value of having options.  He slides a stone into the doorframe and carefully lets the door close onto it.  He steps out for a better view, and discovers that he must walk a long way before he gains any perspective.  He walks the equivalent of several blocks into the forest before he discovers that the building is a dome the size of a huge city.  Snow covers its summit.  Then he has to walk back the way he came to get a better look at the figures clinging to it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They have human shapes, but no clothing.  They splay against the metal as if glued there.  At first he thinks they must be the harvested ones, but he sees no sign of alien activity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" says the little voice.  \"Can't you feel it?  There are no aliens.  Can't you feel it?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not just a feeling,\" says the deep voice.  \"You've lived in there all your life.  You're just putting two and two together!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">No, he feels it, but the small part of him that still reasons tells him that he cannot possibly see what he sees.  He squints, and just barely makes out the doors that outline each distant figure.  They splay there on platforms, absorbing something that, yes, even he can feel.  The entire dome emanates the collective life force of the harvested inhabitants, and they drink it in.  It makes them young, joyful and healthy.  Even he feels a subtle power going into him, even from this distance.  He watches from behind the undergrowth until he sees one of the figures, a man, stir himself, and ride his door back into the dome.  A little time later, the man emerges from another door at ground level, still adjusting his bathrobe.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joseph has never seen such human perfection.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The man in the white robe follows a path into the woods and disappears.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Follow him!\" says the female voice.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For once, the voice tells him to do something he would have done anyway.  He thrashes through the undergrowth, hoping to catch up.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">At least he finds the path.  However, he goes down it cautiously, not really wanting to meet up with the man.  The path winds through the trees for the equivalent of many blocks, until the dome hangs over the trees behind him like an overly-perfect, oversized half-moon.  He comes around a corner, and the forest ends in an orchard.  In the distance, he sees country houses the way they used to look before the aliens came.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There are no aliens, moron,\" says the little voice.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He dares not go much farther.  He ventures just far enough to take an apple from one of the trees.  He looks at it, and sees that it lacks its barcode.  All apples have barcodes growing in their skin.  Everyone knows this.  For the first time in his life, Joseph becomes certain that he is not sane.  The impossibility of millions of people living out their lives in that dome, the impossibility of the collective mind control, proves his insanity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He pockets the apple and hurries back along the path.  In his panic he forgets caution, and so do his voices.  He rounds a corner, and nearly collides with a robed woman.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hi, there!\" she says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She steps around him, and continues down the path, toward the orchard.  Her blissful smile and her vacant stare fail to alter her perfection -- her combination of utter beauty and absolute health.  He feels as though she never even really saw him, like not seeing a sticky candy wrapper.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hurry!\" says the deep voice.  \"Be more careful!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It doesn't seem to matter,\" says the female voice.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's the spirit!\" says the little voice.  \"Show some attitude, like you belong at this party!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He makes it back to his door, which still has the stone wedging it open.  He suspects that choosing to go back inside is the biggest choice of his life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He slips back inside without incident, retraces his route back to the fast-food kitchen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There's a whole maze of corridors here that you need to map out,\" says the female voice.  \"That's one of the jobs of the Resistance.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Whatever that means.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Whatever that means,\" the little voice agrees.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're going to get real jobs now,\" the deep voice says.  \"Training is over.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Whatever that means,\" the little voice says again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joseph steps out onto the street.  The woman he kissed waits right where he left her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What did you bring me?\" she asks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Without really thinking, he reaches into his pocket and hands her the apple.  She spins it around, looking for the barcode.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Impossible, isn't it?\" she says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah, crazy,\" adds his little voice.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She gives the apple a little sniff and tosses it into a trashcan.  She takes Joseph by the arm.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Shall we?\" she says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They walk half a block, and she turns him into another door.  As they go into the sex hotel, she nuzzles his ear.  Marching orders.  He knows he's insane, and chooses it.  He wants to learn her name, but until he scans normal, that would be completely crazy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/steven-mathes/for-your-protection", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">My older sister, Carol, is selfish. When we were little she'd always make everyone late, hog the bathroom, and take the biggest piece of cake. This time she took the whole selfish cake, announcing she's pregnant. She didn't even ask first or discuss it with us, and we had to decide who in our family her baby would replace after the fact.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We were in the kitchen finishing dinner. It was just me, Carol, and Ma; what was left of us. Because Carol's a coward as well as selfish she had blurted it out while Ma's back was turned. Ma stood silent at the sink. She has a way of holding a moment, making it linger, and squeezing every last Planck second out of it so that you almost forget to breathe. \"Who's it gonna be, then?\" she asked Carol in the voice she uses when she's trying to control her anger. \"Someone from his family?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He doesn't have anyone left.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ma gripped the edge of the sink. \"What were you thinking?\" She turned around, her outrage focused like a laser on Carol.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Carol shrugged--she actually shrugged. I told you she doesn't care. Selfish; everything always done for her, expecting the world to curtsy to her whims.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How could you?\" Ma bit her lip. I could see tears welling in her eyes. She turned back and stared out the window. \"Well, it's not going to be your sister.\" Ma declared shaking her head. \"It's not going to be Maggie, she's only thirteen.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I already called The Circle of Life office to set up the interviews,\" Carol said. \"They'll decide if we don't.\" The interviews are mandatory, just in case a family can't or won't choose.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not going to be Maggie,\" Ma repeated. Of course, Carol had ruled herself out and her newest good-for-nothing boyfriend, so that left Ma to be the Hero.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm sorry, Ma,\" Carol said. \"But Granny and Grandpa were Heroes for me and Maggie. I didn't think it was a big deal. You must have known this would happen someday.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Granny and Grandpa were in their seventies and they came to us, your Pa and me.  They told us they were ready for the Exchange. You don't do it like this.\" Ma sat down at the table with us. \"I thought I raised you better.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But Ma raised us fine. Carol's just selfish. That's who she is.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe you could buy a Volunteer,\" Carol suggested.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ma huffed. \"You know we don't have the money for that.

In light of her sarcasm, Oren resisted looking at the screen; it would only be showing him the red arrows of a U-turn anyway.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The street seemed fine; there weren't many potholes, and there was no other traffic at all.  Tall brick buildings lined it close on both sides.  The first few had signs, names and slogans for businesses long gone; as they went along, the signs became fewer and the buildings were simply blank brick walls.  Doors came farther and farther apart, and the few windows were long since covered over.  There were no people that they could see.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The navbox hadn't spoken since they'd turned, but surely it would have picked up their location and calculated a new route by now.  \"What does the navbox say to do next?\" Oren asked nervously.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Tera tapped it, then pulled it loose from the dashboard with a Velcro <i>rrrip!</i> and shook it.  \"It doesn't,\" she said in a very small voice.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It doesn't say where to go,\" she quavered.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's just recalculating.

The screen was a blank grey square.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's impossible,\" Oren protested, looking from the navbox to the road and back with wide eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The brick faces of the buildings seemed blurred now, the corners of the bricks smudged and indistinct.  The road was smoother, without the bump and jostle of potholes and patches, without the rumbling personality of pavement.

As though there were anything to see.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There's nowhere to pull in, though,\" Tera pointed out, and she was right.  The street had become a featureless smear, the buildings subsumed by an emptiness that loomed like walls that weren't there.  It was almost uniformly grey, as grey as the navbox's blank screen.  The view ahead was no better.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe if you turn it off and back on,\" Oren said desperately, nodding at the navbox.  Around them, even the emptiness had faded away.  There was only grey, ahead, beside, and behind.

Many parents have them removed at birth anyway. They aren't useful for anything, and they can become injured or infected. Your daughter will be fine, and perfectly normal once more.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Is her condition... is it very rare?\" The lord asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It crops up most often among the poor, the guttersnipes, the lowest in society--some of them seem to want to cultivate it.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">The connoisseurs milled and mingled from one end of the long, thin room to the other. There were seven different tasting stations set just far enough apart to allow conversation between tables. A nostalgic, almost retrospective feel had been chosen for the night's theme: soft Plutonian cotton covered the walls and examples of the local system's ancient and primitive arts were strategically positioned to take attention from the servers as they poured. Here a rudimentary portrait with smears of actual pigment long dried atop a canvas square; there an open leather binding, its fan of pages each stained with line after line of tiny archaic symbol; even a maze of brass tubing, bent into the most intricate and seemingly unnecessary swirl of what had once been considered a sort of music maker.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The crowd, of course, many of whom found themselves in the backwoods of the Old Earth system for the first time, adored these authentic details. Anything to remind them of their superiority, whether over their past or present peers, was to be considered in the most suitable taste.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford followed his own small clique from one station to the next. At random he'd fallen in with a Hawking Monk and a star broker from somewhere beyond the Pale. They had given their names, at least once before, but Baneford had never had a head for such details. They seemed decent enough. The monk perhaps a little sullen and the broker certainly too interested in the age and history of the regional Sol, but they made for fine, fleeting, and therefore safe company at such an event.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ah, a real Chaledean Red,\" the broker said, letting his nose dip through the opening of the small glass globe he held in one hand, \"you can smell the giant's blood in this one. I'd say this batch came from its L phase, at the earliest.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The monk only nodded sagely. He gave the warm glow of his own glass a discerning look before taking a sudden, bird-like sip. His eyes closed, his lips parted and he let out a contented, steaming breath.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford glanced down, reluctantly, at the globe of liquid light he held. There was no avoiding this. He took a dutiful draught, despite having no taste for the stuff. Less wet than slippery, it had the memory of a long dead heat. It took him back to that first moment, as a child, he had run outside without the visor of his helmet pulled down. The whiff of scorched skin thrust into a freeze-unit. It was the taste of dormant pain.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He did his best to hold back the slight grimace the stuff made of his mouth. It would be bad form to insult anyone here, least of all himself, by exposing his limited palate. He was, after all, assumed wealthy enough to have received the invitation. Everyone knew that, given enough money to throw away, any self-respecting humanoid would be glad to sip nectar from the heart of a star.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So, what do you think?\" the broker slurred his query through a smile. He'd been making a steady round of the seven stations and his skin was already full flushed orange from the residual burn of the potent drinks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A Chaledean Red. What more can you say?\" Baneford returned diplomatically.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The broker slapped him on the back in jovial agreement, but the monk had taken closer notice of him now. He would have to watch himself around the quiet man. Followers of the Hawking way were notoriously dogmatic in their approach to life. They were pleasant enough as long as you agreed with them, but the moment you wandered outside their orthodoxy an enemy was made.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The three men were halfway to the next station when the announcement came. Baneford missed the broadcast. \"I always unplug myself from the tele-path whenever I go sun drinking,\" he'd told the hosts upon his arrival, pleading the staggering headache such a combination would mean for his sensitive nerves. They had shrugged and let him pass; it wasn't unheard of, a purist who didn't like to drink and scrye.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">With the servers suddenly working to close up their tables, it didn't take an internal scrye-line to suggest something was afoot. One following another, the guests each turned to face the single, black door at the far end of the room. Soon the main event would commence. The dark room would be opened at last. And its contents? What was kept on the other side of the door made a palate cleanser out of the galaxy's finest sun drip.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A rush of rarified anticipation ran through the crowd. There was little so curious, Baneford thought, as the sight of the galactic elite rubbing their hands together and licking their lips in anticipation. It almost made them seem normal, filled with the same desires and fears as the rest of the masses. Almost.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The ebullient moment passed swiftly, and a low muttering could be heard. Baneford took note of the particular look of disappointment on the broker's face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What is it?\" Baneford asked carefully. \"What's happened?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They just announced we'll not be following the traditional order of patronage for the final tasting.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ah, Baneford nodded, how could these people ever respect a line that didn't allow them to pay their way to the front? His companion's deep-set scowl told him that the star broker must have given a particularly large sum of money to the Institute of Means this year.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Upon receiving the invite Baneford had, of course, made a donation of the stated minimum. There was only one reason for him to attend this event and he had seen no call to strain his endorsers' hard fought finances any more than was necessary.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He felt a touch on his shoulder. He turned around and was only half-surprised to find the monk staring at him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No taste for sol blood and he refuses the tele-path.\"  The Monk offered some of his first words of the evening. \"Be careful or one might suspect a technophobe.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford flinched at the accusation. It wasn't the first time the word, quite a dangerous one, had been thrown in his direction.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What did you call me?\" he whispered into the monk's forcefully neutral expression. Whatever information the crowd was absorbing over their scrye-line, they took no interest in the quiet confrontation between these two men.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your name,\" the Monk said with the outward calm of a dead planet. His eyes were alive, however, with something akin to a solar flare.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford held onto that stare. It was all he could do. Was this really how it was all going to end? After so much preparation, so much expense. A Hawking Monk was to prove his doom.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What is your name?\" the monk repeated, slowly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Baneford Trappelton, the third,\" he said with every shred of nobility and authority he could manufacture.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The monk smiled thinly. \"Well Baneford, it would seem you have been the first invited into the dark room.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The broker's heavy hand slapped his back and jarred him loose of the moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What're you doing just standing there,\" yelled the broker. \"Get to it so the rest of us can have our turn.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The crowd parted, if grudgingly, in front of Baneford as he made his way across the room. Upon his breaking free of the group one of the Hosts stepped out to escort him to the imposing door.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The host, as per custom, was an attractive female. She wore the close fitting red robe and skullcap common to her kind. Baneford didn't think he'd seen her on arriving, but he couldn't be sure. His eye for such details was, after all, notoriously suspect.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Welcome,\" she said, before bending forward and whispering, almost conspiratorially, in his ear: \"Don't tell anyone, or they'll start ripping out their own psyche piping, but we thought it safest to bring you through first, what with your communication impairment.\" She gently traced the skin at the top of his spine where his tele-path imprint should have been.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford just nodded and did his best to smile. His pulse was beginning to really race now. Such nerves had been one of the reasons he hadn't been fitted for the signature scrye-line befitting his supposed station. Not even considering the expense, a straight feed between his synoptic mindprint and the Institute's security screener would have disqualified him from the outset. Now, as the blood hammered through his body and his thoughts raced between who he really was and the character he was meant to play tonight, he thanked every angel in the cosmos that his unruly emotions weren't currently being traced across a distant screen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Relax,\" the host winked. \"It's not as scary as you might think. We only ask that you follow a few basic precautions upon entry. Simple, really: Do not approach the glass until the door has closed behind you and the lights have been extinguished. Hold out your hand and wait for the glass to come to you. We realize this might be a little uncomfortable for you without the tele-path for guidance. Just remember, whether you can hear us or not, you're in good hands.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She paused to make sure Baneford was taking this all in. He was sure the uncontrollable twitching of his features would give it all away, but whatever small composure his face maintained it was enough to placate her concern.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Most importantly, take only one small drink from the glass. Swallow it completely before letting the glass go. And lastly, don't try to leave the room until the lights have returned. For your safety, the drink has been rendered photo-dormant. No light means no worries. Rest assured, we utilize more than a dozen of the most sophisticated safety features within our dark room, ensuring that the elixir will remain sleeping throughout its digestion. Simple enough, right?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">One final nod. Then the heavy door's seal released with a hiss. It swung inward on its reinforced hinge and Baneford stepped into the small room.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The space was all clean, sterile metal polished to near luminescence. Baneford glanced about quickly, taking in as many features as he could. The pedestal stood five feet in front of him, at the center of the room. The glass, fluted in the old-world style, was made of the same heavy black substance as the door he'd just stepped through. The whole chamber was likely lined with the stuff, some sort of gravity damper, he assumed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The mouth of the glass was covered, of course. It would only be exposed, with the precision of mechanical hands, once the room had been returned to the safety of darkness.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Behind him the door finished swinging closed. There was a metallic thud of locks being thrown followed by the hydraulic hiss of impenetrable seals restored.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>One, two, three,</i> Baneford counted carefully in his head.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The lights winked off and utter blackness owned the room.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Am I ready for this?</i> he wondered. Once he held out his hand the glass would be brought to him. Then there would be no turning back. The drink. The consequences. The plans that had brought him here extended back more than ten years. So many hopes, so many lives were attached. He had never imagined hesitation could arrive within these final moments of a decade's worth of sacrifice, but there it was.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He forced himself down beneath the legion of concerns he had been sent here to remedy. With a final and carefully controlled certainty Baneford held out his hand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There came a whirring of motion through darkness. It grew louder as it approached him. The glass was placed, with the expert precision unique to machine-kind, against his open palm. He held the glass with only a slight tremble, raising it upward and toward his open lips.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The dark glass was open, waiting for him to imbibe. Within it lay the teardrop of a black hole. A compressed singularity, capable of producing enough energy to power an entire system through untold star cycles. A drop of liquid that by itself was proof that no humanoid in the galaxy should ever be hungry, should ever want for heat or the necessities of life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Behind him, on the other side of that heavy door, stood a room full of people hungry to suck down the next oyster on their menu. To such as them the lives of trillions stood pale when compared to partaking in this newest fad.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sol-Eaters, the hungry masses called them from the bottom of the gutter planets they could not escape: Old Earth, Luna, Mars, the oldest and least cared for habitations in the galaxy. They had so little of what mattered: money, resources, influence, power. But what small bit they had was scrimped and saved. A dollar here, a pound there, sprinkle in a few yen and deutschmarks. Gold and silver, spent metals that the worlds had long ago moved past. All ancient currencies, worthless and beneath the interest of the well off, who dealt exclusively in sol blood and dark matter. \"As worthless as a penny,\" the ancient Earthlings might have said. But when, in ten years time, a trillion, trillion pennies had been accumulated it began to amount to something. Enough to manufacture the identity of Baneford Trappelton III. Enough to ensure an invite to the most elite star tasting event the galaxy had ever known.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford, as he answered to now, his other name mere dust beneath a memory, held the black fire to his lips and took a drink.

He couldn't find her, the host that had escorted him to the door. That was good. She was a small detail, and he usually didn't have a mind for such, but this time was different. She'd been nice to him, and there'd been something in her eyes. As if she knew what was about to happen. He imagined she was already safely away from the Institute, halfway to the Old Earth. He imagined it was her story, to tell to the rest of them, the ones not here to witness it first hand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's in his mouth?\" the monk said suddenly, the first true emotion registering on his face: fear.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Baneford's smile widened, his mouth brimming with a gift steeply purchased.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What the hell?\" the star broker asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The monk lunged for him, but it was too late.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The spray erupted from between his lips in a black cloud of infinite potential. Here, outside of the gravity dampers, exposed to the light radiation that charged the place with a perfect waking welcome, the single teardrop of black hole was restored to life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was no pause for reflection, no moment of triumph or tragedy. One instant black spittle flew from a man's mouth. On the back end of that same instant nothing at all remained. No Institute of Means, no fleet of wealth and opulence. All told, the tear in space-time was a relatively small one. Little more than an undone stitch in the fabric of the galaxy. It was just enough to erase an entire class of humanoids from existence, along with their favorite candy store.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">If the host escaped, her story was never told. For weeks, the tele-path blared out its sad story of misfortune and tragic loss; no mention was made of a ghost named Baneford or the desperate interests his action represented.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A few chaotic years did follow, as new players vied for power and old politics refused to loose its grip. It amounted, however, to little lasting change. Certainly star mines were outlawed; sol-eating became a punishable offense. But the masses remained on their aging gutter planets. The nouveau-riche discovered a taste for the next unreachable thing that came along. It was as if nothing had taken place.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Except for that one little pockmark in space: a teardrop of singular violence. It was nothing, in the truest sense. An absence of everything it had once been. The dark glass that had spilled; the man that had made his decision; the society that had driven him to it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Cordoned off and registered as an official site of avoidance, this non space was sure to outlast the humanoids that chose to ignore its warning. It was a single, open hole, and it was filled with the most basic element of creation and destruction: the taste of dormant pain.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/derek-ivan-webster/good-taste", "title": null},

There was no gravity in that place. Dimensions stretched and shifted. A ring in space, kilometers long, spinning. Only the center remained free of gravity. Youssou floated, and his lover floated with him, short and stocky with pale skin. They were both naked, dancing, Youssou clumsy, used to the pull of gravity on his body, his lover more graceful, economical movements, used to this incredible confusing freedom, pale Asian skin against Youssou's tall gangly darkness. Their dance intensified, arousal coursing through Youssou's blood, a shared music passing between their nodes, entwined, the Conversation fading around them, that incessant chatter of network traffic, they moved uncoordinated, the time-lag between them making this mating ritual a challenge, so that they made moves anticipating the other's response across the chasm of space.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Youssou dreamed that he was holding his lover in his arms, Youssou's arms long and strong, and he dreamed his lover whispered words in his ear, words--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Vocal cords vibrating as air played against them, emerging as sound received, compressed by his lover's node and transmitted, a digital packet, bouncing from mirror to mirror and hub to hub, from the ring to Lunar space to Earth orbit and down, moving at the speed of light, down to Central Station to the place where Youssou lay dreaming, there deciphered, translated once again to sound, in Youssou's ear, vibrations running through the cochlear liquid, thousands of tiny hairs moving, translating the waves into electrical impulses transmitted to the brain--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>\"<i>Mi wantem yu</i>,\" his lover whispers, in the pidgin of the asteroids, and across space Youssou responds not with words but with his body's movements, pressing harder against his lover, his hand stroking the man's short black hair, his mouth descending on his lover's neck, kissing, softly at first, then harder, as the two dance, weightless, there in the irreal, in the virtuality of space, a private symphony playing, node-to-node, soaring as they soar, reaching crescendo with their excitement, their lust as it builds, and Youssou could feel his lover's pulse, his lips on his neck on his skin, warm skin and salty on his tongue, naked together floating in darkness surrounded by stars.</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Neighborhoods sprouted around Central Station like weeds. On the outskirts of the old neighborhood, along the Kibbutz Galuyot Road and Siren Road and Sderot Menachem Begin, the old abandoned highways of Tel Aviv, they grew, ringing the immense structure of the spaceport rising high into the sky. Houses sprouted like trees, blooming, adaptoplant weeds feeding on rain and sun, and digging roots into the sandy ground, breaking ancient asphalt. Adaptoplant neighborhoods, seasonal, unstable, sprouting walls and doors and windows, half-open sewers hanging in the air, exposed bamboo pipes, apartments growing over and into each other, growing without order or sense, creating pavements suspended in midair, houses at crazy angles, shacks and huts with half-formed doors, windows like eyes--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In autumn the neighborhoods shed, doors drying, windows shrinking slowly, pipes drooping. Houses fell like leaves to the ground below and the road cleaning machines murmured happily, eating up the shrunken leaves of former residencies. Above ground the tenants of those seasonal buoyant suburbs stepped cautiously, testing the ground with each step taken, to see if it would hold, migrating nervously across the skyline to other, fresher spurts of growth, new adaptoplant blooming delicately, windows opening like fruit--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Inside his house Youssou woke with a start. It was hot, the humidity making his naked skin slick with sweat. His heart was beating fast inside his rib cage, the tempo of a machine gun, like a panic attack. He breathed with an open mouth, trying to stem the panic of this nighttime awakening, the Plateau he had been mainlining earlier in the evening leaving his system alongside the alcohol, making him clammy and scared.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He was alone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A candle was burning on the windowsill. This neighborhood was still fresh, young, and the adaptoplant was green and vibrant. As it grew older lighting a fire became more dangerous, the drying wood became a firetrap, but Youssou had only recently moved here, and the air still smelled of the fresh, grass-like scent of the adaptoplant bamboo.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The candle cast a small circle of light on the hut. It was sparsely furnished. Youssou slept on a mattress on the floor. The mattress had been salvaged, some time ago, from the flea market of Jaffa, where virtually anything, from cheap soap to decommissioned battle drones, was for sale. It was saggy and the springs were too old, and stains from previous occupants created a startlingly colorful spiral on the face of the mattress, like a letter in an alien, sublime alphabet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Beside the mattress a misshapen table grew out of the floor, its surface sloping at a sharp angle. On the floor beside it was an ashtray and a small bag of Plateau and a small piece of paper rolled into a tube. There was a <i>nargila</i>--a water pipe--by the door, a torn open packet of cherry tobacco, tongs, and factory-made coals. Youssou had gotten entangled in the sheets. He pulled them off him now with some difficulty and stood up. He walked unsteadily to the hole in the floor on the other side of the room, in the dark corner farthest from both the door and his sleeping area. Adaptoplant plumbing seldom worked well. A half-finished toilet grew out of the floor here but it was useless. Youssou had ended up punching a hole in the floor instead, and now he squatted over the hole, muscles straining, nothing but emptiness below.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A roll of toilet paper sat hanging from a branch and he used it. Down below, the old empty highway stretched. He could hear a solitary cleaner moving down below slowly, a murmur of approval as it found fresh excrement to digest. Youssou washed his hands in a basin full of dirty soapy water, another flea market bargain, dried them on his thighs, and went back to the mattress.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A mosquito buzzed by his ear, startling him. He tried to shoo it away. Already, the details of the dream were fading, the giant space ring, spinning, losing its solidity. Of his lover's fevered need there remained only the bland memory of pale skin and Asian eyes and a Belt accent whispering words he could no longer recall. He sat with his knees to his chest, on the edge of the mattress, hugging his knees, staring into space. Beyond the open window the stars shone down, but they were few and far, so different from the stars as seen from space, free from light pollution and atmospheric interference, so many billions of stars for the handful seen from Earth. But already the dream was fading, and those other stars.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He didn't want to go back to sleep. At long last he got up again, wrapping the sheet around himself, and went to the door. He stepped out, onto the adaptoplant ledge. A sleeping city of leaf and branch rose around him, eerie in the light of a sickle moon. Palaces of vegetation! Dreaming castles in dark greens!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There were other figures on the ledges. Even at this late hour he could hear snatches of music, conversation, laughter. He walked cautiously along a branching pavement in the air, reached a tilted Gothic palace, a ruined fountain semi-formed hanging suspended, a flower that had opened early. Water gargled in the cup of the flower and fell down in a thin misty sheet. People sat here, on the ledge, legs dangling over the empty highway. Someone was playing a guitar.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hey, Youssou!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's the matter, couldn't sleep?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Want a smoke?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Got any food?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Good-natured, empty questions. He accepted an offered smoke and joined them, sitting on the ledge, looking at Central Station.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It dominated the sky, the view, it was the whole world. Central Station, in the place the giant monstrosity of the Tel Aviv bus station had once been, the largest in the Middle East, now rose the space port, and sub-orbital planes and RLVs landed and took off high above, picking and discharging passengers. Around Central Station its neighborhood still sat, a mixture of elegant Bauhaus and uglier concrete blocks and Martian <i>Moderne</i>, of bars and birthing clinics, fruit and vegetable stalls, caf\u00e9s and apartments, shoe stores and places of worship, a humanity concentrated in the old tired streets.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Around it, still, the old highways, and sprouting high above them the adaptoplant neighborhoods, roofs rustling in the wind, and Youssou took a toke on the joint and sighed, the smoke floating out of his mouth, the dream fading further still as he, at last, relaxed. A cooler breeze up here, from the sea to the west.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Conversation washing over him, the droning of the night creatures, these modern tree-dwellers, nomads of the bamboo streams. He wondered what Yan was doing, whether he was asleep, and felt a momentary tightening in his chest, of shame or affection he didn't know.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Kranki, too, was dreaming. In the small apartment overlooking the Ne've Sha'anan pedestrian street, the hub of the old neighborhood around Central Station, Mama Jones watched the boy sleeping, feeling a familiar mixture of affection and worry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Kranki was not like the other children. His dreams floated in a grey cloud above his sleeping head. His eyes moved rapidly. Mama Jones could not discern any details from the dream. It was like watching shadows through a fog. She wondered what he was dreaming, where he thought he was. She worried about him, she remembered him as a baby, a small brown bundle with a serious face and deep, unsettling blue eyes, an Armani trademark hacked and spliced into his gene pool at the birthing clinic.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy's mother had been a Crucifixion junkie, an addict of liquid faith. She had finally taken an overdose and ascended to heaven in a glare of white light. Mama Jones had seen it, had passed down Fuenn Street, which was more commonly called Pin Street, or simply Fuck Street by the residents. It had been named after a Russian Jew, a scholar and author, Samuel Joseph Fuenn, but when his name was transliterated into Hebrew the spelling looked like <i>Pin</i>--meaning <i>penis</i>. For generations it had been occupied by prostitutes and junkies and their pimps and dealers, by rundown sex shops replaced by tru- and synth-flesh pits and immersion pods offering a virtuality of sex. Mama Jones did not like walking down that street, always keeping an alert eye. What she saw that night, however, had a touch of the sublime about it: she saw her second cousin, Anat, lying on the ground with her back to the wall of Number 1, the notorious establishment that had sat there, in one guise or another, since long before the space port was built. Anat was a Hebrew name now, but it had come from Ugarit, one of the defunct dead languages of Mesopotamia, and meant virgin, and was also the name of a war goddess, the companion to Ba'al. Miriam remembered Anat as a girl; she had been thin and beautiful with long hair woven into dreadlocks that moved above her head, Medusa-fashion, which had been the rage that summer. Her eyes were brown and her fingers long and her parents adored her, and she and Miriam were close, sharing secrets, talk, laughing together, whispering about boys.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But even then there had been an emptiness inside Anat, a need that found no answer, and Miriam remembered one night, when she had come into the room they both shared, and found her cousin on the floor, hugging a pillow to her chest, her eyes staring into the darkness with a look of terror in them that Miriam, in her turn, found scared her. Anat was shivering. Miriam knelt beside her. \"What's wrong?\" she said, inanely.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anat shook her head mutely. When the words finally came they were halting, hoarse, torn out of her unwillingly. \"There is\u2026 nothing,\" she'd said. \"Nothing.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Miriam knew what she meant. Existentialism, it used to be called. Wondering what your place in the universe was, if anything meant something. It had been worse for the nodal generations, post-Cohen and the Others, when that thing they called the Conversation, that incessant chatter of humans and machines, spread out across the solar system, from Earth outwards, to the moon and the asteroids and Mars and beyond, to the outer system. Miriam patched into Anat's feed and reeled back: Anat was blind-surfing, hungrily, all ports open and exposed, letting the Conversation flood in, drown her:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>A memcordist's feed from the New Kibbutzim on Mars, a volunteer experiencing kibbutz life in the red sand deserts, working in a hothouse filled with medical-grade marijuana plants, budding, the smell of them choking the air, Nuevo Kwasa-Kwasa music beating--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>A spider floating in the cold dark  space of the Oort cloud, seeking a suitable rock to crash into and convert into others like it, a Von Neumann machine at the edge of human space and the Conversation, listening to the distant music of the spheres--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>An anthropologist on Dragon's World, on Hydra, that frozen moon orbiting Charon, where Dragon dwelled, that strangest of Others, the anthropologist's feed sending out confusion, images she couldn't quite interpret--thousands of Vietnamese-manufactured dolls moving within the warrens of Dragon's World, ice-tunnels carved into the moon, thousands of small simulacra moving like ants, a single mind inhabiting them, and the anthropologist, her name was Chen, she wanted to understand but couldn't, and Dragon's voice whispered in her node, <i>there is only one way to find out</i>...</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>And closer, from Lunar Port, fleeting impressions of Sandoval's <i>Earthrise</i> as experienced by a five-year-old girl, a tourist from the Belt come here with her parents, the long graceful journey by ship, and all that space, this domed city spread out across vast land, so different from her home on Vesta--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>Deep sea divers in the Atlantic searching for a lost shuttle submarine commuting to the underwater cities, but something went wrong, an engine fault, submarine and all passengers presumed dead--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>Volcanic eruption in the Solomon Islands, seen from the shore, people fleeing, smoke thundering, lava flowing like evil fingers grasping for human lives--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>A murder in Sydney, a man lying on the ground beaten by men with shaved heads and living tattoos crawling over their arms and necks, laughing--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote>A traffic accident as one or both navigation units malfunctioned, a truck like a living dinosaur, with striped solar panels over its back, crashing into a small family vehicle somewhere in North America, one of the only places they still had cars--</blockquote></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Miriam had torn herself away, locked the feed, come back into the present clammy, her heart beating too fast, shaking her cousin, saying, \"Stop it. Anat. Stop it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her cousin groaned. \"Nothing,\" she said, listlessly. \"There is nothing.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That night she had stopped Anat, had brought her back. But then they grew more distant. And Anat flitted, like a bee in summer, from flower to flower, taking nectar, seeking solace in boys and girls and sex, but later losing interest in it altogether, discovering and discarding drink, dope, wire-head, Plateau, working her way through the pharmaceuticals until, at last, she discovered faith.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But it was not the faith Mama Jones had. Mama Jones believed. Belief made life worthwhile, a belief in something greater, something wondrous. But many people lacked belief, many could not believe, even if they desperately wanted to. And so Anat had discovered Crucifixion. Belief administered in capsules, absorbed in the blood stream, belief suffusing the brain, neurons firing, showing you... God. Showing you <i>something</i>.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Making belief possible.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She was passing along Fuck Street that night and she saw Anat, lying there, her back to the wall. Something made Miriam hesitate, halted her steps. A light came down upon Anat, a white light, without a source. An impossible light. Later, she couldn't tell whether it was real, or whether she had somehow patched into Anat's own visual feed again, like that time long ago. The light came down and Anat's pinched, haunted face changed--she smiled, the smile lighting up her entire face, transforming her. She seemed to rise towards the light. Miriam cried out, at last, and the light died, and Miriam ran, she ran to Anat, she knelt beside her but her cousin was dead.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>God overdose</i>, they called it, on the street. The funeral had been a simple, sombre affair, the cemetery was a vast underground cavern, once a club of some sort. The dead of Central Station lay down below, entombed. A simple headstone, a date. Miriam attended, cradling Kranki in her hands. A small brown bundle with intense blue eyes, a baby who could do strange things, and it rained at the funeral, it rained underground, a localized rainfall, water coalescing around Miriam and the child, never touching them, surrounding them in a circle like a seal.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>We look after our own. There is no one else to</i>. Kranki was a marvel to her, a child, a living, breathing thing, how could you not believe when you held a child in your hands, she marveled, how could Anat not see it in him?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anat's having a child had been the talk of the family, it was a surprise, no one had expected it, she had gone to the birthing clinics, Central Station was full of them, they were said to be as good as Yunan's, she had submitted her gene map and the doctor, it could have been Boris, even, he'd said so himself, to Miriam, the doctor compiled a child out of hacked genome and stolen code and who-knew-what and one day there was a child. Miriam remembered Anat's face when she first held Kranki in her hands, when she first brought him home. Ecstatic. Joyful. As though, for just a little while, she was able to believe.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And, for a little while, maybe she did believe. Then came the dark sleepless nights and the terror and the drugs again, Anat opening herself up to the Conversation in a way a human could not take, getting high on the <i>Toktok blong Narawan</i>, the high-bandwidth encrypted exchanges of the digital intelligences called Others, dropping Crucifixion as if it were the Third Coming or Xenu's Approach or the Gorean Singularity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>We look after our own</i>, Mama Jones thought, watching Kranki, watching this strange child, his dreams like shadows in the air above him. <i>There is no one else to</i>.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yan?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Youssou.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He sat up in bed. Yan had taken to sleeping by the labs, in Central Station, Level 5. A small but comfortable room, no personal items, machines came and cleaned and tidied up each morning. It was easier that way, less to distract him, he had everything he needed within himself. He liked the work. They manufactured viral ads, spliced organics coded with digital, spores thriving in a closed, air-conditioned environment, like flu, infecting their targets, delivering a dose of compressed sensory data that bloomed unexpectedly in the human's node, offering fabulous holidays, cheap servient appliances, sexual delights, and religious awakening, depending:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Walking down the Level 3 Concourse, for instance, a passenger from Tong Yun City on an Earth visit, heading perhaps to the battle drones arena, or to a Louis Wu emporium where wire-heads lie on divans with a charge in their head, suddenly stopping, a confused look entering their eyes, their motion like a person suddenly and inexplicably underwater, reaching out a hand, in wonder or annoyance, to something that isn't there--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">While in their hijacked feed the world is transformed and a heavenly choir opens up in song:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><blockquote><i>Feeling depressed?

A sudden longing inside him, the narrow bed empty, no one beside him, longing and a desire flaming, tightening the muscles in the pit of his stomach and he said, \"Youssou, where are you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I couldn't sleep--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The picture now, Youssou sitting on a ledge of tree, feet dangling, drinking beer, his upper body dark and cool in the night and the lights of Central Station, his nipples hard in the breeze from the sea, and Yan, his throat tightening, said, \"Do you want to come over?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They'd had a fight two weeks before.

Youssou and Yan broke apart, self-consciously, smiling, fidgeting, and the waiter began to cover the table with plates:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Hummus with olive oil and paprika; fried eggplants; mushrooms and peppers pickled in lemon juice; tabbouleh like a small green mountain of bulgur and parsley and mint; tahini with cucumbers; tahini with chili; Turkish Salad--a spicy tomato dip; fresh celery in sharp lemon juice that sears the tongue; a plate of hot falafel balls; a plate of small, bitter olives, glistening; on and on the salads and dips went on the table, filling the space between the two men, resting in every available space, and the crowning glory, two enormous flatbread pitas, dripping in olive oil, covered in <i>za'atar</i>, that pungent green mix of dried <i>origanum syriacum</i> leaves mixed with salt and purple sumac and roasted sesame seeds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'll be back for your order in a moment,\" the waiter said, finally depositing a jug of fresh lemonade (mint leaves floating in the murky liquid like seaweed), and left the two men alone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Yan felt the glow of the candle between them reflected in himself; a soft warm suffusion of light running through him, making his skin translucent against Youssou's night sky. He watched him, with affection and exasperation and that something else, that ill-defined feeling he did not dare put a name to, as Youssou, oblivious, tore a chunk of bread and dipped it into the hummus, drawing it across the thick paste, then plucked a falafel ball and placed it on top, then, with a fork, added a little of the spicy Turkish Salad, putting the food into his mouth, crumbs falling. Yan watched in fascination as Youssou put his whole being into the act of eating.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Also in the restaurant that night was Miriam. She sat self-consciously, Boris, Boris Chong, facing her, looking calm and relaxed but Miriam did not like heights, and she did not like Boris' aug, that thing rumored to have been bred out of dead Martian microbes, pulsating gently in and out against Boris' neck, a parasite attached to its human host until it became, almost, a part of him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And yet she cared for Boris, in a way she found uncomfortable, for they were not young any more, they were not the two young lovers for whom the word itself, love, came so easily, so glibly, who held each other's young bodies on the roof, under the stars, and whispered words that meant, years later, nothing. For Boris had left for those same stars, taking the lifts up to the very top of Central Station, taking a flight into orbit, to the habitat called Gateway, and beyond. While she stayed, she had responsibilities, a family, now a child to look after, it had always been easier for men, she thought, to go, to leave, while the women stayed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Kranki was home, she had left him with Boris' sister. She watched him now through the house's feeds, the boy sleeping, turning, small fists bunching and dragging the sheets with him, inch by torturous inch. She worried about the boy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She looked up. Boris was gazing at her; he smiled, he raised his glass, white wine swirled inside it, there was still something boyish about him, and something of the boy the girl who shared her name had loved, so long ago. It was still strange to her, that he was here.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Isn't that your cousin?\" she said, seeing the two men sitting, across the room, by the windows overlooking the Jaffa high-rises.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Boris turned, his face transformed again, affection making them softer, almost vulnerable. \"Yan, yes,\" he said. Miriam remembered him as a boy, he had been born long after Boris had left, a small, shy boy who grew into a compact and serious man.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He looks happy,\" she said. Boris turned back to her, his smile uncertain, he raised his glass again, as if he had forgotten he was holding it and suddenly remembered. Miriam raised her own glass, it felt too large, the wine came from the Galilee, their glasses touched, the smallest note sounding. She sipped. It tasted of the sun, and strawberries. \"Will you be going back?\" she said, the question erupting out of her, unexpected and unwanted, evacuated in force out of her mind, her throat, too late to take it back, to unask it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The smile slipped from Boris' face, the aug pulsated gently, hypnotically, on his neck. \"I don't know,\" he said--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She said, all in a rush, \"I shouldn't have asked--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, no,\" shaking his head, \"you have every right to. I should have thought to--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He had come back from the stars and they had found each other again, but--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I spoke to the clinic,\" he said, unexpectedly. \"I could have my old job back.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Something inside her sighed, an easing of a tension she did not know she carried. A waiter materialized by their table, tall and skinny, hairy arms exposed, said, \"What will you have?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I wanted to talk--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Fish?

Youssou stirring, a flatbread fragment still in one hand, \"Yan, look--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That silence again, something hurt Yan, like a panic attack crawling to the front, the beating heart and the short breath and he grabbed the edges of the table--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I like you, Yan. You know I do. But...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A sudden suspicion, the way Youssou's eyes kept shifting, his persistent, continuous eating. Yan reached a hand and turned Youssou's head, his fingers resting on Youssou's chin: \"Are you high?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Youssou shrugged his hand away, laughed, but there was a false note in the sound. \"Only Plateau,\" he said. \"And I finished the climb, I'm on the level now--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Yan cursing, in Arabic, the words harsh and ugly in the softly-lit room, \"<i>Kus emak</i>, Youssou--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Fuck you, Yan!\"--with sudden vehemence that surprised them both, a box in Yan's pocket, his fingers around it but now it won't come out. He had bought it for this night, had booked the table in advance. He had prepared--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Youssou, wait--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But Youssou stood up, the chair pushing back with force. He shook his head, tiredly, said, \"Forget it,\" and walked off. Yan was left alone at the table, heat rising to his face, his fingers turning and turning the small box in his pocket, turning and turning, uselessly. He stared after Youssou's back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Silver blade moon hanging in the sky, you could barely see the shadow of the spiders, crawling on its surface. Lights up there, stars and ships, it was as if the Grand Lounge did not exist, the street was all there was in that it was real, cheap and dirty, full of the smell of raw sewage and lamb shish-kebabs, fatty, roasting on an open grill, and someone spat, loudly and wetly, and Youssou walked away. He walked away from Central Station, from Yan, he was going back into the trees, he felt safer there, less vulnerable.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Why did Yan have to go and spoil everything?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He was so angry. Angry at Yan, angry at himself. Yan didn't understand. He had his job, his family, that whole Chong clan, his whole <i>comfortable fucking existence</i>. Yan was the worst product of this <i>fucking</i> immigrant mentality, that even after three or four or five generations still hung about, genetically-coded into each successive generation in some awful mockery of evolution.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Petit bourgeois <i>crap</i>. Job, security, make babies to repeat same. What did Yan think he <i>was</i>?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He stood and breathed deeply, unsettled in the shade of the space port, his mouth open, tongue protruding slightly, upset at what Yan had been about to say, and at himself, for leaving him there, and as he stood there he saw Kranki, standing a few feet away, that strange reticent child from the birthing vats, looking at him, with eyes as dark as olives. Youssou said, \"Kranki, what are you doing here? You should be at home--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The air between them seemed to shimmer, for just a moment, as if Youssou's visual feed was gently messed with. He put an open hand forward, as if to stop something, or lean against something, but in either case there was nothing there.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy came closer. He looked up at him, a serious expression. \"In the dreams,\" he said. \"Do you like it?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What dreams?\" Youssou said, but he knew, the boy knew, and he whispered, \"<i>Nakaimas</i>--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Black magic, in the pidgin of the asteroids. The boy had it, they all knew it, he was not the only one to have it, either. Something new. Something old. A quantum child born of probabilities. He said, \"You look into my dreams?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy nodded. Youssou said, \"How?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy shrugged.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Youssou let out breath. He had not told anyone of the dreams. It was not something he consciously did, or at least that was what he told himself, waking up in the morning, the stains and the sweat and the feeling of guilt, at himself, at Yan. His sleeping mind rode the networks, somehow hooking up with others, in the Belt, on the moon, on the other side of Earth--a dreaming that was at the same time real, two minds, two bodies meeting in that no-space of the Conversation, coupling, de-coupling...</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy shouldn't have seen it. \"Do I like what?\" Youssou said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy said, \"When you fly.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And out of nowhere came the thought of a space habitat, spinning, Youssou and a sad-faced dreamer at the hub, floating, slowly, in midair, stars above them... the boy, like Youssou, had only ever known the pull of gravity.

Yes.\" The boy said, \"Heavy,\" and looked at him, sad-eyed, and then, just like that, he was gone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>The little shit</i> was <i>home</i>, Youssou realized.

There are hundreds of construction projects going on around the city right now and most are in need of our services.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The Morgat scoffed, \"I don't doubt that--my people actually take some pride in their progress, unlike you humans.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">His voice betrayed condescending pride as he spoke, and although he had intended to offend Jaren's humanity, in reality his barbs had missed the mark. \"I've always admired your people's commitment to progress, from the time I was just a young boy in one of your government's civil service camps.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You were in a camp?\" Inquired the Morgat.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jaren nodded. \"I expressed an interest in serving with the occupation forces, so I was displaced from my parents and put in one of the camps. My test scores weren't high enough though....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And so they placed you in the exterminators,\" interrupted the Morgat, seemingly unaware of Jaren's admiration. \"Now let's get to this job you're going to be doing for me. I have a huge pest problem in the basement. They've taken over. I need you to get rid of them.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As he spoke, Jaren looked around the interior of the building. The Morgat must have caught him looking; he nodded in approval. \"I see you've taken notice of my restoration. You should recognize it: a fully restored 20th-century human hotel, complete in all its decadence.\" He pointed with delight to a crystal chandelier hanging above them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't understand,\" said Jaren, \"Why would you rebuild a human structure?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'll admit that it isn't to my tastes,\" he replied, \"but some among my race find your culture fascinating. I am going to run an authentically human boutique hotel.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I can't understand why they would prefer this,\" said Jaren, \"I'm a human myself and I have always felt more at home in your species' sterile metallic environments than my race's... opulence.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's quite rich, coming from a human,\" said the Morgat. \"Do you fancy yourself one of us?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jaren could feel the blood rush to his face. \"I would never presume--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The Morgat laughed again, \"Enough,\" he said. \"You have a job to do. I'll leave you to your work. The basement stairs are over there.\" The Morgat pointed to a doorway in the back corner of the room, before himself retreating up the master stairwell and into the office.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As he reached the bottom of the basement stairs, Jaren reached into his backpack and removed his rifle. In centuries past exterminators killed mice and insects; they would have found such a large weapon unnecessary. Modern-day exterminators had it worse. His vermin were bigger, smarter, more dangerous. Many of his colleagues went out on jobs never to return.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jaren began stalking from room to room in the darkness. Suddenly his ears perked up, having heard a whimper coming from a large storage closet in the back of the basement. His prey. He crept over and threw the door open, and a loud scream came from inside.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And there before him sat the vermin, huddled together in a clump in the middle of the room. They were not insects, not rodents--they were primates. Humans.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jaren raised his rifle. He heard the sound of his own voice, speaking coldly. \"You shouldn't be hiding here, squatting on Morgat property. You should be registered and living in the ghettos, like the rest.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The humans gave no response, and for a minute there was an agonizing silence. Suddenly a man he had not seen in the corner lunged out from the shadows. Without thinking, Jaren discharged three rounds into the man's chest, dropping him where he stood.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Daddy!\" the cry came loud and abrupt, and a little girl broke free of her mother's embrace and rushed over to the corpse, in tears.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Look in the mirror,\" said the girl's mother, her eyes widened by terror, revulsion, and pity, \"You're not one of them. You're one of us. Stop this.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her words evoked a familiar feeling. Images of his mother's tearful face the morning that he chose to join the civil service flooded him. She had tried to fight it--to say that he was just a confused boy, that he really belonged here with his people. He remembered feeling profound loss as he was escorted away.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jaren blinked. In a moment the internal conflict had passed. These were not his people, not now, not ever.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, I'm not one of you,\" Jaren said to the woman, choking back on his bile. He pulled the trigger--first the mother, then the little girl, then the others. He left none alive.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When the job was done, he once again climbed the basement stairs, his face covered in blood. He was anxious to report back to the Morgat; to tell him what a good job he had done. He knew that he could never be one of them, but maybe, just maybe, the Morgat would hire him to work in the hotel, or be his assistant. Who knows, in time maybe he could--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That was fast,\" the Morgat said, \"Well done.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thank you sir,\" Jaren replied. \"I was wondering....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes, yes of course, your payment,\" said the Morgat, misunderstanding his intent. He handed him a slip of credits. Jaren was about to speak up again, when the Morgat dropped a hammer. \"Now get out of my sight,\" he said. \"Just because I employ vermin to kill vermin doesn't mean I want to keep them around afterwards.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jaren's heart sank in his stomach at the words. He took his leave of the Morgat. He would never be one of them. He would never be human. He was an exterminator, and that would have to suffice.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/erik-b-scott/the-exterminator", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">The first thing you need to understand about gel, is that there is no reason, at this point, to assume it is in any way harmful. Certainly, if you were to slip in it, fall and injure yourself, that would be bad. So tread carefully. Avoid stepping in gel especially; it is the slipperiest new substance. Gloop is a bit thicker, it has a sort of syrupy, marshmallow-like texture, at least as compared to gloop, but nevertheless--tread carefully. The same applies to gunk, gack, gludge, fludge, and frunk, but we do not have space here to address these relatively rarer varieties of new substance. If necessary, a supplement to this document will be created later. The present document will, from this point forward, confine itself to gel and gloop.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Grass grows under gel, and while it does die under gloop, this is most likely due to gloop's property of opacity, which ranges from roughly 88-94%. Grass, due to the nature of photosynthesis, requires sunlight, which it cannot get when covered in gloop.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Gel ranges from 21-25% opacity, or 75-79% transparency, and this appears to be adequate for photosynthesis. So if gel covers your lawn don't despair!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Gloop however, will result in the need for reseeding if at some point it becomes possible to have your yard cleared of it. We are working all the time on ways to remove gloop and gel, (more about that later) but please know also that we are always open to new suggestions from any quarter. We're available Mon-Fri 8-4:30 Central Time, and by email at any hour of the day or night. You can also join our facebook fan page or follow us on twitter for the most up-to-date information. Our contact information is given at the end of this document, and we genuinely enjoy hearing from you. Even complaints!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Another suggestion for the owner of a lawn under gloop is to create a rock garden. The white color of most gloop contrasts nicely with reddish or black stones. Use large stones. Pebble gardens can themselves become buried under gloop, as the substance has been documented continuing to rise as much as four inches above the original thickness at which it has appeared in any given locale. This rising can take place over the course of several months. So again, use large stones, or you may find the need to lay down another rock garden sooner than you would like.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Do not eat gel or gloop. While it has never been demonstrated that accidentally ingesting small amounts of new substance has caused any long-term harm, neither gel nor gloop has any nutritional value, nor to speak frankly, and rumors notwithstanding, does it have any narcotic properties. Typically, animals will not eat gel or gloop, so your pets are safe. Infants and small children, however, have been known to consume either variety of substance while left unsupervised. Again, there is not one single documented case of serious poisoning through ingestion of any new substance. However, it is the position of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) that, at least until further study is completed, ingesting new substance should be avoided, and we accept these rulings. Do not eat these things.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">While consumption of gel and gloop is easily avoidable, some contact with skin and clothing is less so. You will get gel and gloop on your skin, and certainly on your clothes, from time to time, and you need to be prepared for this. It can be frustrating (especially if you're the one who does the laundry in the house!) but again, it is not dangerous.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Gel is cool to the touch and slippery, but we caution against its use as a sexual lubricant. Of course, we cannot stop you from engaging in such a use, and again, there is no known health risk to doing so, but gel was not created for this purpose. Gloop, needless to say, would not be useful as a lubricant of any kind, and it is unlikely any warning against such use is needed. However, just in case: Don't do it!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Many people do ask us why gel and gloop were created. The specific answer to the question contains proprietary information that cannot be shared at this time. However, we can say this. New substance was created in the pursuit of a higher standard of living for all. Our company has always been committed to making a better world, but even the best intentions may, at times, involve setbacks. We know that gloop and gel are setbacks, and we are committed to working hard, alongside civilian government agencies, responsible citizens groups, and the military, toward viable and economically-prudent solutions to their spread. Several years ago a privately-funded activist group released a study which famously predicted that, by now, three-quarters of the Earth's land mass would have been covered in gel, gloop, and related substance.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">However, the reality is that today no more than 42% of the planet's arable lands are covered. And the spread of gel and gloop is slowing all the time. At this rate, the world will not be entirely covered in new substance for at least another decade. If you think back on the changes in the world over the last ten years, you'll realize what a long time that is, and how much can be accomplished in such a period.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Nevertheless, we are committed to ending this so-called crisis. Our facilities have postulated several new products that, we feel, represent the best chance yet toward retarding, and perhaps eradicating, gel and gloop. The R&amp;D for these counter-substance solutions has not come cheap, but we are committed to making them available. That is why it is essential you contact your congressional representatives and tell them you support passage of the current emergency funding bill. Without this aid, we cannot assure development of these promising new solutions, nor is it likely we would be able to make them available in sufficient quantity, and in timely fashion, if they are developed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We take full responsibility for this challenge, and we believe, with the support of the American people, we will rise to it, as long as we are able to obtain funding to do so.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We are not the enemy. We are your friends, your neighbors, your community. We are you. And, if you're willing to give us your help, we'll be able to help you too.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/michael-canfield/facts-about-gel-gloop-and-other-semi-viscous-substance-you-may-have-encountered-recently", "title": null},

Then after the door closed, melted back to a warm red.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She leaned across the cafe aisle toward Maggie. \"Thermodynamic body sleeve,\" she explained.  \"It's the latest.\" She glanced at Maggie's cotton shirt and jeans, smiled stiffly, and turned back to her companion.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">On the other side of Maggie, a lady flounced the sleeves of a blouse. The fabric resembled human skin. \"It's all synthetic of course,\" the lady said loudly to her husband. \"Part of the Death and Decay D\u00e9colletage collection.\" She peered about and caught Maggie's eye, as if by accident. \"It's the latest,\" she said with a giggle. She lifted her chin at the sight of Maggie's long brown ponytail and gave a terse nod.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie blushed. Stared down at her hands. There hadn't been time for a manicure. Aunt Joan messaged only that morning. She would be in town for one day and could Maggie find some time because she would absolutely love to see her favorite niece as it had been entirely too long and she knew just the place.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie indulged in a smile. Aunt Joan had been a model once. During the romantic era of magazines. Pages filled with perfume samples that floated onto Maggie's lap like butterflies.  Joan was tall, fashionable, sublime. She had fluttered in and out of Maggie's youth, as fragrant and colorful as the photos she adorned.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie had been waiting at her table for half an hour when the door to the cafe finally opened. Aunt Joan waltzed in, tossed her coat to the Ma\u00eetre D and strode across the restaurant. Her long green dress swishing like seaweed. Expertly dyed hair slipping about her cheeks in shiny waves. Lips red. Eyes bright.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But there was something amiss with her pashmina. Maggie squinted. Then blinked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Draped over Aunt Joan's shoulder was a small baby. Its face nuzzled into her neck, its small body heavy against her collarbone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Darling!\" Aunt Joan opened her arms in the gesture of a hug, but sat down before they could connect. The baby slipped a bit, and Aunt Joan grabbed its small head and rump, and casually readjusted it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Aunt Joan called for the waiter, ordered the chef's specialty, and sent him away, all in one breath.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She gave the table a friendly pat with her slender hands, just beginning to show the soft raised veins of age. \"Now Margaret, dear, tell me everything. How is school? Your classes?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie beamed. \"Aunt Joan! You have a baby!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why yes!\" Aunt Joan said brightly. \"I just got it. What do you think?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"She's beautiful! Or is it a boy? I don't care! Can I hold her?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can try it on later if you'd like. I haven't the slightest if it's a boy or girl, but it should be beautiful considering how dearly I paid for it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie gave her head a quick shake. \"I don't understand, did you adopt--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Adopt? How pedestrian! Margaret dear, it's the latest fashion. A re-invention of an old accessory--do close your mouth, Margaret dear, you're making yourself most unattractive--Women have been wearing babies for years, of course,\" she continued, with a note of disdain, \"but in these cumbersome slings or packs or some other contrived plebeian conveyance. Completely ruins the lines of an outfit. This baby is fastened here and here.\" She pointed to the baby's feet and hands. Maggie could see now a nearly invisible, heavy-duty zipper from the baby's booties to the armpit seam of Joan's dress. \"The other attaches at the collar,\" she explained.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The baby didn't seem to be moving except for a gentle rise and fall of its soft rounded back. Maggie felt her lungs quiver. \"Is it sleeping?\" She whispered.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sedated.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie slumped in her chair.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It wouldn't look nearly so darling crying and thrashing about and all that.--Do sit up straight, Margaret. Oh, but they are darling, don't you agree? Babies just seem to bring about an air of beauty and youth,\" she added with emphasis. \"It's the only reason people have babies, you know. Because it makes them look good. It really is high time they marketed them.\" Aunt Joan pulled lightly on her earlobe, \"Where is our lunch? I am famished.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The baby sighed softly. Maggie's arms went weak.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Whose baby is that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, some Swede. Or Fin, I think. A Scandinavian to be sure. You can pick up a black or brown one for next to nothing, but no one who's anyone wants one of those. Let me tell you, dark colors may be slimming--\" she stopped abruptly and pressed her lips together. \"How crude of me,\" she dropped her voice. \"That doesn't bear repeating, dear. You understand.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The baby on Aunt Joan's shoulder twitched. Maggie could see its little eyes moving rapidly beneath closed lids. It was dreaming.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If you want to stand out,\" Aunt Joan continued, \"you'll want something exotic. Like a Filipino. Or a Kazakh. Why, I have a friend who has her very own set of twin Inuits.\" She shook her head. \"Some people just have money to burn, I suppose. Oh good, the fois gras!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Aunt Joan moved her napkin as the waiter placed the pate on the table.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not that they're expensive, really,\" she explained,  smearing some pate on a cracker, \"it's more the maintenance, you know. The sedation drops. The upkeep. I bring mine to a shop every evening to have it fed and cleaned and, well, you know.\" Aunt Joan pointed to her abdomen and made a small discrete circle. She wrinkled her nose. \"It's not proper to discuss over lunch, but, you know.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh! You mean it doesn't..?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh heavens no!  Fine supplement to couture that would be!\" She laughed. Maggie tried to join in.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, the shop cleans mine out nightly. Some combination of laxatives and diuretics. Then some opposite concoction in the morning before I pick it up. But let's be done with the sordid details. Pat\u00e9?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Does it have a name?\" Maggie asked weakly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Creation Couture. Though a rival designer refers to his line as Motherhood Masquerade.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Aunt Joan rubbed her neck. \"I should have purchased a preemie,\" she sighed, \"delicate frame like mine.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maggie felt a little dizzy. \"What happens when the baby gets too big to wear?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Aunt Joan waved her hand dismissively. \"Oh, they'll be out of fashion by then.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The door to the restaurant swung open and let in a draft.  Aunt Joan shivered and pulled the baby closer to her neck. Rearranging its legs like the cowl neck of a sweater.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman beside their table glowed blue. \"Is that the Creation Couture fall line?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why yes,\" Joan replied,  \"A must-have item of the season. They are positively toasty.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman smiled carefully then looked down at her thermodynamic body sleeve and  frowned.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Suddenly Aunt Joan sat up very straight and pursed her lips.  \"But I thought certainly I'd see some women wearing babies here. Perhaps this cafe isn't as chic as I'd thought. \" She cast her eyes around the room. \"Oh wait, here comes someone now. I knew I'd picked the right--oh good god!\" She whipped herself back to Maggie, \"she's brought in a live one.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The new patron lumbered past them, weighed down with a diaper bag, umbrella stroller,  sling, backpack, and baby. She took a seat at a table near the lady wearing death and decay d\u00e9colletage, unbuttoned her blouse and began to nurse, calmly looking over the wine list.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Aunt Joan's head gave a Parkinson's-like shudder.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Waiter!\" She snapped, \"We'd like to change tables.\" She stared hard at the young mother.

My shaking hands made the light shimmer on the scalpel.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just do it,\" Jamie ordered through gritted teeth.  His Regulator was curbing the worst of his fear, but the exposed back of his neck gleamed with sweat.  \"For God's sakes, just do it, just cut it out!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My Regulator thrummed at the base of my skull and my own panic began to steadily fade.  <i>Thank you</i>, I thought.  <i>For once, thank you</i>.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jamie's blood was bright and warm on my fingers when I started to slice, but my hands were steady.  His Regulator lay just beneath the skin, an ugly metal spider that stretched its legs deep into his brain.  I pulled out the tendrils one by one, ignoring the blood running down my hand.  Jamie moaned.  His Regulator vibrated in my hand, but I had pulled loose the wire that would have blunted the edge of his pain.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's almost done now,\" I said, gripping the last, biggest wire.  I yanked it.  It sent a jolt of electricity up my arm.  Jamie jerked, once, and fell still.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Jamie?  Jamie?\"  He didn't move.  The blood spilling out of the incision slowed to a trickle and then stopped.

I'm Jamie.  The window in my compartment is jammed.  Mind if I use yours?\" he asked.  I nodded, mute with surprise.  He crossed the compartment in a single bound, flung open the window, and swung a leg over the sill.  \"Thanks!\" he said brightly, and toppled out into empty space.  A euphoric whoop echoed after him.  I raced to the open window and looked down.  Why?  Any moment now, my Regulator would kick in, flattening my shock and blazing curiosity into a manageable degree of mild interest.  Before that happened, I leapt after him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then I was shrieking with terror and the wind was whistling in my ears and I couldn't breathe, I couldn't breathe, and I could feel my blood racing in my veins and my heart was beating rabbit-quick in my chest and the river was rushing up to meet me and my body was alive with fear and panic and adrenaline and nothing, nothing in my carefully Regulated life had ever felt as good as this.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">By the time we both made it to shore, our Regulators had begun releasing their soothing baths of chemicals.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why the hell did you jump after me?\" Jamie asked, shaking water from his red hair.  \"After having an extreme emotion spike like that, you'll be zombified for hours.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I could feel my Regulator humming, settling numbness over me, and I knew I only had time to ask one question before it stole my sense of curiosity entirely.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why do you do it, then?  Why jump off a train if you'll feel nothing for hours, after?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"'Cause Regulators take exactly ten seconds before they activate.

The government keeps them within certain safe limits, but we can have feelings.  We're just Regulated,\" I argued.  He laughed and adjusted the straps of his parachute.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"See if you still believe that after what we're about to do,\" he suggested, took a running start, and flung himself from the cliff.  I followed him over the edge.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not enough,\" I said afterwards.  We lay winded, side-by-side on the ground, our Regulators buzzing busily.  \"These little ten-second doses.

She had such a beautiful smile and the bluest eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We spend our nights together, all of us.\"  I made a circle with one hand and pushed a finger through it.  \"Do you understand, together?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The alpha did not respond.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Doesn't matter.  There's no armor, just flesh on flesh, all those who can manage.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I laughed.  \"It would be quite a sight--if you could ever find us--all of us tangled in a mess of limbs and sweat.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We share with everyone... if only for a few minutes.  It's not just the sex, though that's important.  We know our duty, though we all have our preferences....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Santiago and Jacobs had drifted together, their fingers now entwined, their rifles still rigid in their opposite hands.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's about contact, hearing another's heartbeat, tasting another's taste, breathing another's breath.  Odds are we'll never get another chance.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I closed my eyes.  \"My father, my alpha, died on the second day.  He didn't know he was my father.  We aren't supposed to know.  We're all family by choice, if not always by blood.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It didn't matter that I knew, or how I knew.  Sentiment makes you sloppy, careless.  He was just a soldier who'd lost a step over the years.  But his instincts were still good.  He worked point without complaint until he took a blast that might have killed dozens.  My sister held his hand as he died.  I don't think she even knew who he was.\"  Or who I was.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Santiago gasped and shook her head, confirming it; a tear trailed down her face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Twenty-one more fell that second day--most when you Twil destroyed that town around us.\"  I nodded my grudging respect. \"Ruthless.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We still managed with sixteen.  By day, we destroyed your crops, burned your orchards, smashed your towns, slaughtered your people... and sowed our seeds.  At night, we loved whoever was left.  Other crews no doubt did the same.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's been ninety days now.  Long enough for our transports to slingshot around in your system, aimed toward another Twil world.  There were five of us left when we came today...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Four really... Digby just barely alive, but he'd taken the bullet when he was supposed to--so that Jacobs didn't have to.  I'd kissed Digby on the mouth and had given him a little squeeze--where I knew he liked it.  He'd smiled a bloody smile, and I'd said, \"See you soon, you tubby poof.\"  Then his eyes went blank.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The alpha stared as I muttered, \"Digby was a lazy piece of shit...\" The three women laughed, nodding.  \"But he was family.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Those Twil who killed our man today were going to be our seed, before...  Well, their loss, your luck.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I put my hand around the alpha's throat. \"Say what we are.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The alpha croaked, \"Human.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I clapped my hands.  \"English!  Wonderful!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I nodded to the others and held my rifle on the Twil while Santiago, Jacobs, and Yancee stripped away their armor.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We had just one world, and you Twil destroyed it.  We can't stand against your fleets, so now we hide in the darkness, running at the speed of light.  Some of us just keep running, too fast for you to catch, living and dying between the stars, making sure some survive.  Others, like us, visit your worlds, one after another, reminding you that we're still here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The women stood now, bare from the waist up.  Jacob's breasts were small and pink, Santiago's large and dark.  Yancee had a griffin inked across hers--and a mole I'd said looked like a comet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I put my hand on Yancee's swelling belly, her hand pressed over mine; Santiago and Jacobs rubbed their own rounded stomachs.  I asked, \"Do you understand what this means?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The alpha nodded.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Good.

Not all of us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The women dressed as we prepped for the run to the hidden extraction ship.

She carried a bulging backpack that threatened to consume her slight frame but that she pretended wasn't heavy. Her shoulder-length blond hair was perfect; she somehow escaped having the bedraggled look everyone else had when they came in from this nasty New England cold.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And here I was, the school counselor, with a beehive of nerves in my stomach.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Megan was conscientious, impatient, smart, and hellbent on becoming a judge by age forty-five. She adored the career projections I provided, pouring over the estimates, asking how the confidence intervals were calculated, and adjusting her extracurricular activities to increase her probability of admittance to Harvard Law. She reminded me of Jeff Gardner, a student I advised eight years ago, except Jeff dreamed of heading the American operations of one of the big Chinese auto companies. And he never had time for friends.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We need to talk about Susie,\" Megan said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Susie Anderson, her best friend since first grade, was the opposite of Megan. They complemented each other's faults and strengths. She knew what she wanted out of her future just as much as Megan but she had very different priorities. She was reassured by her projections, content with the estimated low standard of living if her life contained sufficient adventure.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Megan made her pitch. \"Her projections are awful: low income, shorter lifespan. It's already too late to prep her for a decent college. She hasn't invested any hours in mastering something. Most kids have 2,000 hours in a skill or profession by now.\" Megan had 6,000 hours of mock trial experience already. \"Now, I know you can't discuss her problem with me\u2026.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Which was her way of probing to see if I would do exactly that. Instead, I said, \"Does Susie think there is a problem?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No. That is the problem, Mr. Hernandez,\" she said. She straightened her shoulders. \"I thought the point of the projections was to improve student outcomes post-graduation. Why haven't you pushed her?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Whether I have pushed or not is between her and me,\" I replied, and added, \"Did you compare her stress estimates and stochastic happiness index scores to yours?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She glared at me. Her chance of developing a stress-related illness by age fifty-five, based on chosen profession, personality type, and family history, was north of sixty percent. Probability of a nervous breakdown was seventy percent if she failed to make the judicial bench by forty-five.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I am in the 99th percentile for mature thinking,\" she countered. \"I know there is more to life than climbing the ladder and having other life goals is okay.

They always pick up the most wear.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Herk hesitated. \"We make our own luck,\" he said. \"Ya know?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Who was Herk to talk about such things? The biggest piece of bad luck possible had written itself across his face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jane shrugged. \"Yeah,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She put the pen away as Herk's head retreated back to the cooler, sweeter air outside. She'd sign it after the fight, if she could.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Checklist in her head as she strapped herself into the haptic skeleton, gleaming bones lying along her flesh like an eager companion spooning her. She ran through the servos: right thumb, ring finger, index, third, littlest finger, then the hand itself. Bend, flex, check the lights, one by one. Just like one of the smaller suits, even if each finger was now wide around as her waist. Herk was fussing with the right ankle still, but gave her a go ahead on it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Money all around her, but it hadn't kept things in repair. You could tell how new a rig was by the little details in the chest space: how many scuffs clouded the metal, whether the brace around a camera was spikey with frayed wires, rips on the fake-leather of the upholstery. Interior wear visible only to the wearer and therefore allowed to accumulate because what the audience couldn't see didn't really exist. This one was the pits, no matter how cherry red and white the exterior might be.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Servo check 1-10, 11-20, 21-30... 115 altogether, and you couldn't afford not to test every one yourself, no matter how the automated tests glowed. Sometimes people resorted to sabotage. Rumor said Herk hadn't been above it himself, which was one reason Jane had hired him in the first place. Herk knew what to look for.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She thumbed the control and the struts folded out from the sides, filling the space with the intricate bracing that would allow the huge metal suit to take a blow from its fellow without crushing the tiny occupant. The sound system began to blare.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Herk knew the machinery the way she did. He'd been the same mix of athlete and script-kiddie, a fiddler and fixer with razor-sharp reflexes, honed to video-game quickness. Plenty of them out there, all trying for the big fight, the spectacle, the one whose video clips would be viewed over and over again, generating revenue and side profit, the kind that could lift a family out of poverty, out of subsistence level.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">No more knowing you were just a scrounge away from starving, a medical accident from sleeping in the streets. No more teeth-grinding frustration, constant aching worry about rent and power and food and let's not even think how you're going to add in transportation and clothing, days when you patched your shoes with cardboard and duct tape, because a new pair was a financial hit you wanted to put off as long as you could. No more stealing soap and toilet paper from lavatories, loving free samples, taking extra food whenever you could in order to wrap it in a napkin for later.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">No more dumpster diving and defiantly wearing the discards, blazoned with orange spray paint, to school the next day, a big \"fuck you\" to the monied who'd rather spend time making their discards unwearable than give them to the poor.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Now that she'd been fighting, now that she'd edged them past the boundary of poverty, they ate all right. They could pay basic tuition and heating bills and buy those shoes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She still scraped the household bills to the bone, flensed them in the name of putting away for the unanticipated eventuality, the kind that was always coming like jabs to the gut. Punches that could cripple if you didn't have money to cushion the blow. She hovered above the line of disaster, knowing sooner or later they'd fall down.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That was all she wanted, a safety net for her family. What she worked for. That was the right thing to do. You do the right thing, day by bay, carve out a life however you can, even if you had to climb into a mecha and face death each week to do it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Determination tightened her jaw like a screwdriver. The IV slid into her wrist, beginning a slow seep of speed and euphorics meant to carry her through the fight.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Fancy drugs and fancy equipment, no matter how run down it might be. Like the screen displaying the social networks, ticking off the number of thumbs up people clicked on, showing they were rooting for Coke, rather than the competition. Though the competition would be raking in its own: some people liked to support the underdog.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A feed like this, with a keyboard for her own observations, contracted for 5-10 before the fight and another 5-10 if she won. That was a benefit of the big-fisted circuit, rather than running the mini-mechas that the smaller chains used. Some of those were warming up the crowd: Papa Johns battling a many-tentacled Five Guys in her left-hand side screen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She had to admire how the Five Guys fought. It took skill to handle more than one set of arms, took a twist of the brain that she'd never managed. Kids could pull off that sort of thing, the kids raised from birth wired into video games.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Or gene-spliced to make them better fitted for the suits. That batch was just starting to hit the circuit and she wasn't sure what she made of it all. She could see why some were calling to split the league, put the gene-augmented against the gene-augmented.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But everyone was doing it nowadays, even if it was just the basic package the government handed out free: perfect teeth, an intelligence bump, and a slew of other things designed to cut down on health care costs and make you a better worker.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Everything was changing, but no matter what, the crowds would always want people like her supplying the blood for their circuses.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You sure about that ankle?\" she said over the talkie.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Herk's voice was scrubbed raw with weariness. They'd been through thirty fights in as many days; both of them needed a rest. \"You want to do my job too, now?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He had as much riding on this as Jane had. She couldn't have made it to this fight without Herk behind her, making sure she fought unhindered by glitch or lag, the sorts of things that led to so many downfalls.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The question had trembled between them for days, ever since they'd found out she'd be fighting for Coke. Time to let it out, so it wasn't cluttering up her head during the big moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Herk,\" she said, \"it bother you that I'm up here 'stead of you?\" <i>Is that why you're doing it,</i> she wanted to ask. She bit back the question.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Not an ounce of hesitation. \"Sis,\" Herk said, \"you're doing the hard work. All I gotta do is watch the boards and scream if I see the other guy sparking.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Another voice overrode them, bright as a match's flare. \"I hate to interrupt the tender interlude, but I wanted to check in.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lucia. Her manager.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Go ahead,\" Herk said. \"The ankle's okay, but I'm going to check the arches.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's a thirteenth fight, Lucia,\" she said. \"Did you know that? Is that why the other guy dropped out?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You told me you weren't superstitious,\" the clipped voice said. \"You said--and I quote--'Move me up where the money is, no matter what it takes.'\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She clicked on the ventilation system; let it sigh out disappointment for her. \"Fair enough.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can back out if things don't feel right,\" Herk said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Bullshit,\" Lucia snapped. \"Not without forfeiting money that you don't have. You said you wanted to be where the big cash is, wanted a fight that'd keep your family comfortable. This is how you do it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The upholstery smelled of sweat and blood, but maybe that was her imagination. This behemoth had won twelve fights so far.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Battling for the corporation. Which was its own machine, its own inexorable construction, capable of decisions. And sacrifice and compromise and even games. No one wore those machines. They had gotten too big to ever be human.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The mini-mechas are finishing up,\" Lucia said. \"Some op broke his arm. Aren't you glad you aren't working the petty circuit anymore?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sure. Up here in the big leagues you didn't break your arm. The scale of these suits was monumental and so were the risks. You didn't walk away from an injury incurred in one of these.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That was why they were safer, statistically speaking.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That was why a death in one paid out so much.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maybe she'd dreamed last night. Sometimes the drugs took her when she was outside the machine, made her see things, hear things, imagine things. She pushed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Goddamit, Herk,\" she said. \"You sure that ankle's all right? I could have sworn it wobbled.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You just want a reason to back out,\" Lucia said. \"Thirteenth fight, my ass. You've got cold feet.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She was trying to bait her, she knew, but the words' hook bit in nonetheless, pulling a reply out. \"All right.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She let out a sigh. The ventilation system seemed to pick up speed, as though in anticipation.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Couldn't put it off any longer. She signaled acquiescence with a nod, switching on the sound system. It blared in on her, hard rock fight music, amping up the speed in her system.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She said to the air, \"Anything it takes, eh, Lucia?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There's big money on this fight.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She said, \"It's better than a kid from the sprawls should ever be able to aspire to, isn't it, Lucia?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's not what I think at all,\" Lucia said. <i>Was that sincerity in her voice?</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are you sure about that ankle, Herk?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Herk's dispirited voice said, \"What do you want me to say, kid?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mr. Smith,\" Lucia began, \"you'll be in breach...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Herk continued, talking to Jane alone. \"Yeah, it'll be the ankle, just as you're thinking.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Smith!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You go try to shut me out of this channel,\" Herk said. \"See what good it does you.\" He addressed Jane again. \"You know and I know. It's time for Coke to go down, for Pepsi to rise for a while, keep the wheel turning. Trick is to throw the fight without getting killed, do it before whatever they've got--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">His channel went dead.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Jane,\" Lucia said. Her voice was very calm, very deliberate. \"Are you ready for the fight, or are you going rogue on me?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" she said. \"I just wanted to let you know I knew, that's all. I heard you two talking last night.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The music sang and roared. The drugs had her wrapped in their embrace. She was ready to fight, ready to kill, barely able to think of anything but battle.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But she persisted. \"Anything it takes. Even going into a fight knowing I'll lose. You could have told me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's better if you don't know the set up ahead of time,\" Lucia said. No apology in her voice. \"Otherwise sometimes we have to censor things.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I see.\" The music screamed at her, dragged her into the moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The vast machine, four stories tall, stepped forward hesitantly towards the waiting opponent, which matched it in size. Sun beat down on the gorge all around. The crowd's roar wasn't audible at this distance--they were far away, watching on video camera. Drinking their sodas, holding the cups up, and cheering for their robot. Their beverage. Their symbol. Shills in the crowd passing out free samples of new products and sheaves of coupons.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Money was the new blood; you just had to get the right exchange rate.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">With this fight, her death would lift them far enough away from the edge of disaster. They'd have good lives. Bought with her blood.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But that was all right.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She stepped forward and the machine stepped with her, shaking the earth as though she was the most powerful creature in the world, even as she felt the betraying wobble in her ankle, waiting to falter, while the music told her lies and she surrendered to its promise and the match began.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/cat-rambo/on-the-big-fisted-circuit", "title": null},

Hundreds of thousands of dynamic images loomed in front of her eyes, data so complex that the human brain was incapable of processing it. She felt dizzy, nauseated, lost.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Welcome to the city of Shantou's  \"Compound Eyes\" system, which connected hundreds of thousands of cameras and image recognition artificial intelligence. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, the system kept under surveillance the city's every street, every corner, every expression on every person, searching for signs of crime or acts of terrorism and protecting the lives and properties of the inhabitants. Mimi was now an invader in its heart. She examined the feeds one by one.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But that was too inefficient, a technique bounded by the habits of the flesh. Mimi reorganized the logic for presenting the video feeds and re-created all of Shantou from a first-person point of view based on the geography of the streets and the locations of the cameras. Unlike regular human vision, this was a view where each perspective was all encompassing, panoramic. It was like Correggio's dome fresco, <i>Assumption of the Virgin</i>, at the Cathedral of Parma, where everything around the observer appeared in a vortex of concentric rings, with the vanishing point of the perspective the apex of the dome. As the observer moved closer, more details were revealed at the center of the vortex without end.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Imagine the world as a strange apple. The depressions at both poles are deformed and deepened until they connect, turning into a doughnut. The skin of the apple, meanwhile, remains intact and can slide up and down the \"hole\" of the doughnut like an endless treadmill. The observer is situated somewhere in the hole, and what he sees is the ring-shaped world endlessly unfolding.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">More fantastically, as the observer moves towards any point in the wall of the doughnut, the point would automatically open up, expand and surround the observer in a new doughnut-view.

Rationally, she knew that her body was still imprisoned in that tiny corrugated-iron shack quaking in the storm and that her consciousness was only about a dozen kilometers away, wandering inside the dull, metal boxes of a data center. However, the images swirling around her gave her the illusion of having transformed into a winged angel gliding over this concrete and steel jungle. Her virtual body swept over streets, passed through houses, shops, bridges, parks, elevators, trains, and buses; and glanced quickly into countless lit windows, not overlooking any spot.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It was dusk, but the city was already awakening into a sparkling tapestry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In the rain, the traffic crawled through the city's main arteries and capillaric side streets like gleaming blood. Hundreds of thousands of equally anxious and numb faces hid behind the windshields, cleared by the unceasing sway of wipers that polished the wet glow of neon against glass.

Exhausted face after exhausted face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The offices in the skyscrapers were lit bright as day. The giant eye zoomed in and observed a hundred thousand faces staring at computer monitors through closed-circuit cameras; their tension, anxiety, anticipation, confusion, satisfaction, suspicion, jealousy, anger refreshed rapidly while their glasses reflected the data jumping across their screens. Their looks were empty but deep, without thought of the relationship between their lives and values, yearning for change but also afraid of it. They gazed at their screens the way they gazed at each other, and they hated their screens the way they hated each other.

The cameras went through a series of quick cuts and the focal distance was set to maximum in an attempt to follow the flight of one particular bird.

I kicked another can as I walked down the cramped street, snorting at the vacuous smiles and cheap promises of the blaring advert.  Only the Uppers had anything worth being jealous of--the rest of us were left tending jealousy itself.  My job packing boxes had kept my head off the pavement, but the roof that kept the rain off my head couldn't keep the grime out of my lungs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Beyond the nineteenth floor, past the fog and amongst the Uppers, the air was cleaner.  Life was cleaner: the smiles were genuine and the food was real.  But packing boxes wouldn't get you past the fourth floor, and the fourth floor might as well have been the pavement.  I ignored the lights of the vid-board and focused on something more tangible.  You know where you are with an empty can.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lately, I'd started to mess with the Uppers' boxes at the factory.  I'd ignore a sharp edge on a child's toy, or take out the fail-safe on a housewife's blender.  Mix apathy and resentment and simmer for twelve years.  Would they be jealous of their own lives when they were missing a finger?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It made me sick.  That there were people up there, past the fog, who could be bored with their clean air and clean food.  People who would actually pay for a course of Reappreciation.  People who thought that three weeks among the rest of us could justify their decadent lives in the Upper levels.  Three weeks, surrounded by the smog and the violence that we had to call home.  If I ever found one of those secret Uppers, I'd make him eat his wife's blender.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It wasn't long before the factory caught me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was fired without ceremony, but my sympathetic boss introduced me to one of his neighbors on the fifth floor.  This neighbor sold various powders that often reached a woman on the Habitation Committee, who could set you up on the 23rd floor in probationary employment as an Upper Custodian.  There were no guarantees--you'd have one week to prove you could burn rubbish at street-level and polish a window worthy of reflecting the Uppers' white teeth.  But if you could make it work, you'd be free of the fog.  You'd just about earn enough to pay the rent and keep a well-maintained filtration unit, and once you were among the vertical elite, who knew?  You might find a girl who still had a head of hair, and she might endorse you for a vasecto-reversal.  Of course, no one on the Habitation Committee liked to dish out free life-changers.  There was always an agenda, and always a price: papers to be stolen, people to be silenced.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I never thought I'd have to kill a child, though.  Somewhere out there was an Upper who had broken his vows, and now he wanted to get elected.

Another stood by the elevator.  \"He's waiting for you upstairs, sir,\" the guard said, and he pushed the elevator button.  Murdoch looked the man over while they waited.  He wore a crisp black suit, black tie, and mirrored sunglasses, though it was the dead of night.  Murdoch studied his reflection in the guard's silver lenses, tightening the Windsor knot in his own tie.  The man stared ahead like a department store mannequin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The elevator chimed and the doors slid open smoothly.  They went in.

You're one of two dozen students sweating in a seminar room, agonizing over an application form.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Working with those less fortunate</i> you spy on the forms of the people near you.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Not interested in a big salary as long as I have a job I care about.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">If you get this job, you'll live with these people for two months, <i>helping others</i> and <i>facing new challenges every day</i>. Will their bland, worthy aspirations get on your tits? Absolutely. But you need a residential job until term starts again. The campus halls are locked and your Ma's renting out your old bedroom to a junior electrician.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Your own application sounds too heartless, too efficient, by comparison. You add a treacly sentence--<i>my long-term goal is to make the world a better place</i>--and sign off--<i>Abbie Oderinde</i>.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The results will be announced in an hour. Nervousness draws you like static to the other applicants, and you cluster on the college green. They all look about eighteen, like you. Mostly women, like you. White and well off, not like you (so if you get the job, they'll already be <i>working with those less fortunate</i>).</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What did you write on your form?\" asks Tamsin. She looks like a fawn, brown hair and big eyes. She volunteers with refugee kids. \"I sounded like such a do-gooder!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I driveled on a bit about social justice,\" says Ed, a gangly politics student of no particular gender.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Everyone laughs and admits, yeah, they're do-gooders. They liked the vague but worthy LYSCom job advert--<i>change places, change lives</i>. They each have a different unrealistic guess as to the specifics of the job.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Even the dismal pay is a draw for them. You're practical, you've done a lot of sums; a proper job would pay more, but work out worse after rent and bills. But God, the other applicants are actively smug about being paid peanuts. It puts a seal on everyone's sanctity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Why does their do-gooding grate on you? You agree with them: the world's skewed. But they're so bloody sure that they're the right people to straighten things up. And that confidence comes from the skew being firmly in their favor.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The LYSCom spokeswoman trots out onto the grass to announce the successful applicants to the group. She mispronounces your name and beams. Thank the Lord--you've got the job.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thank you for your dedication!\" says the spokeswoman. \"Together, we're going to transform distant, inhospitable environments. Together, we'll test whether they can sustain human life.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Fantastic! You're going to be a coalmine canary.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The others whoop with excitement. And why not? It's exotic, it's daring, and it's making the world a better place.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You're paired with Ed. Tamsin swears she'll keep in touch. Now they're not your rivals, you feel more generous. These people might do some good; why not let them try? Why pre-emptively kick them in the teeth?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maybe your pragmatism, of which you're so proud, is actually holding you back. Maybe it's just low self-esteem in a fancy suit. Maybe their effortless confidence will rub off on you. That could be useful.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's a city made of snow!\" Through the comms, Tamsin gasps like a boy wizard meeting a dragon in a kid's film. \"With ice domes! It's so beautiful!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Wherever you're sent, you vow, you're going to be totally chill about it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You and Ed are put down in a desert. Grass creeps up out of the sand, then shrubs spring from the grass, trees from the shrubs. Then walls of butter-colored rock: a stepped city, carved into the side of a mellow yellow mountain. Over the city flap huge white shade-sails. Like a ship in the desert.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's it look like?\" Tamsin pleads, over the comms. \"Ed? Abbie?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hot,\" you say.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Bit dusty,\" deadpans Ed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You enter the empty city. It's too big, it's God-scale, but the buildings are made of rounded sandstone so that even the largest looks warmly human.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Strange style,\" says Ed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah. Sort of... Biblical-futuristic?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's odd--they must have used incredible equipment to build it, but it looks rather organic.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah.\" That makes you wonder what kind of tools LYSCom has. You imagine a tiny crew of LYSCom workers opening a huge wound into the side of the hill, doing in an hour what innumerable hands couldn't do in an age. Then buildings rising out of the ground like an exhalation.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You and Ed are allowed--encouraged--to go anywhere. You're free-range canaries. You choose a building, push a wooden door. Indoors, the arched roof is hung with starry lamps.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do you think this will be?\" asks Ed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A school?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There's no furniture yet, but you find a kitchen with meters of worktops.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This kitchen could serve dozens of families,\" Ed says, while you eat from tins. \"Or young people, living in dormitories. I expect LYSCom's got interesting plans. They don't need to stick to one house per family, one room per kid--those Western cultural norms.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I used to share a bedsit with my Ma and my brother.\" You're pointing out that you're normal, Western, and cultured, and that Ed's being clueless. Ed just nods, as though you're agreeing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That night, you compare notes with Tamsin. She's feeling daunted in her huge warm cave complex. \"But it's OK. If there are going to be thousands of people living here--maybe refugees....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She's saying: <i>If they can, I can. And if I don't, they can't.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She's in touch with some of the other new employees, who've been sent to an empty tropical island, or a steaming jungle, or a rocky sea-lashed shore.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You submit your first nightly report to LYSCom. Everything's functioning, everything's fine.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You find another room, unroll your sleeping bags. Ed paces the length of it before lying down. \"Twenty-four.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"People who could sleep in here, in bunk beds. Rather incredible.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">On the second day you and Ed are told what you were sent to perform. LYSCom asks you to check that the surfaces of the walkways and steps are safe and even. So you climb cobbled paths, cross un-tilled terraces.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Did they ship the soil out here?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe there's some sort of quick-growing plants,\" says Ed, reaching down to touch the earth. \"Then ravenous quick-digesting microbes....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Jesus, don't poke it, then!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Fair point. Wonder what food they'll grow?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You've also been asked to test the chairlift. You're swung over the city on a slim metal cable. A moment of terror--what if it snaps?--then at the top, you step out onto a flowering plateau. White desert foxes streak away between the rocks. Nothing but dunes to the horizon. It's more space than you've ever had.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">What would it be like to stay here? Give up college? Would the company let you be a resident, work the fresh earth? You turn to Ed to share the idea, but Ed looks nauseous, maybe with vertigo.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That lift could only carry twenty people an hour.\" Ed says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"For a city this big?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But it's only bringing people to a park. This isn't where people work, they don't all need to clock on here at 9am.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You both look down at the white sails, the slices of gold between, the desert beyond.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You ask: \"So where do you reckon the people <i>will</i> be working?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ed? You awake?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hmm?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ed, why aren't we farmers?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Silence from Ed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I mean, why didn't they send farmers here, instead of us? They'd know about irrigation, climate. We don't know. We can't report that everything's OK.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ed mumbles that you're educated generalists.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What use is that? You think we know better than farmers?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ed turns over and snores. You shouldn't have asked, but you couldn't sleep.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The city made you stupid, but it's wearing off. Why would LYSCom whisk refugees away to a snow palace, or a flowering desert? Why not spend the money on tents, medicine, peacekeeping forces?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">People aren't poor because there isn't space--literal, habitable space--for them. They're not poor because of a lack of ice domes. You're not an economist, but you're not an idiot.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The task LYSCom sends, next morning, is to check the plumbing. You think hot angry thoughts while spinning taps and splashing water into a hundred hand-basins.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You blame the rich kids. You wanted their confidence to rub off on you. Instead, you got their naivety. You imagined this city full of Tamsin's refugees, sleeping in Ed's egalitarian heaps. The old frontier story, but with a happy ending.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You discover narrow staircases in a few buildings, leading to the first human-scale rooms you've seen: the servants' quarters. The style of the city implies a pledge--<i>everything gets better for everyone</i>--but the floor plans say otherwise.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You show Ed. You both look for more proof.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The building where you've been sleeping isn't a school. It's a huge private house. The kitchen is vast, but it's not a canteen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The soil isn't deep enough for crops. The pools are too shallow for fish farming; they'll be full of slow-circling gold carp which will never be eaten for protein. The building you thought might be the city parliament is kitted out for rock gigs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Tamsin'll be furious,\" says Ed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah. She's really...\" You think, and swallow, \"na\u00efve\" and \"deluded.\" \"She's dedicated.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Still, at least this was uninhabitable land, before,\" says Ed. \"Imagine if there'd been people living here, and LYSCom had turfed them all off....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Who told us it was uninhabitable?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh dear. You won't say that to Tamsin, will you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I suppose you're right,\" says Tamsin. \"You couldn't grow enough food for people to eat, here, even with all the glass domes. And keeping the temperature stable must cost a fortune.\" She's heard similar doubts from the islanders and the jungle-dwellers.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So none of you have been sent to these exotic locations to make the world a better place. You're not brave canaries, you're underpaid caretakers, tending holiday camps for the hyper-rich.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do we do?\" asks Tamsin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We could publicize it, when we get back,\" says Ed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We can't keep working for them! For weeks!\" Tamsin's voice rings round the room where you've been sleeping. It'll echo less when they lay the thick carpet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You can't afford to break your contract. \"They didn't lie to us,\" you point out. \"They just hinted.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Tamsin indignantly disconnects herself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But why even hint?\" asks Ed. \"Why not say: we've built a rather good holiday resort, can you test it for us?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You imagine students recruited to test this place as a holiday destination. Spilling beer in the fishponds, dangling drunk off the chairlift. With the right company, in the right frame of mind, you might have done that yourself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But instead, you dutifully examined steps and tested taps. And climbed the terraces like an awe-struck child, and tiptoed across the mountaintop.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The next day, it's still hard to see the city as ugly. It was built to beguile, and it does its job. You don't care. You weren't invested. You were smart. You throw canned meat to the desert foxes. You let the daily tasks from LYSCom pile up and you make your nightly reports entirely at random--yeah, maybe, no.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The following week, LYSCom comes to collect you both. As you lift off, the city looks like a pile of coins, then a heap of sand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">LYSCom pays you off. You get a bar job. You worry about Tamsin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then Ed brings a newspaper into your bar. There are a lot of photographs for such a small story, because the images are so spectacular.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You see smoke licking great grey tongues up the sheer white slopes of the snow-city, blackening the dome to a dark pearl before it cracks. Huge fragments rebounding like hailstones. You see a column of steam half a mile high, a pale volcano, because sabotaged water pipes are emptying like a mighty fountain into geothermal boreholes. You see Tamsin led away by police, her fawn-like face ash-streaked and grinning, with one fist punching the air.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And the moral is?\" Ed asks. \"Hell really doesn't hath a fury like a woman scorned.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Or: don't mess with an over-entitled idealist.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You know, I think we could sell interviews. To the papers. Perhaps?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You could use the money. Tamsin could probably use it too, for her legal fees.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">While you decide, you drink to making the world a better place.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/e-saxey/canaries", "title": null},

I'm here at the southwest tip of Australia, where we're just moments from our first glimpse of the tragedy unfolding on Saturn's moon, Titan.

How far away is Jupiter, anyway?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, Saturn is... at the moment, about eight hundred thirty-seven million miles from Earth.

There's not enough naturally occurring oxygen in Titan's atmosphere to support large-scale combustion. The extractors that draw oxygen from Titan's ice appear to have remained operational long enough for the fire to spread to the surface, which is covered with lakes of liquid methane. Methane wants to combust. That's why we use it for fuel. That's what CQ was doing on Titan in the first place.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How long until it does die down?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, there's no guarantee it will. Once some of those methane lakes are burning, gaseous methane will bond with the abundant nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitromethane, an extremely robust explosive. This is where the chemistry starts to get... dark. Nitromethane's a monopropellant, which means it can burn in the absence of oxygen, because it already contains a small amount in its molecular structure. There's a threshold beyond which enough nitromethane is present in the atmosphere to keep the cycle going indefinitely, and we have every reason to believe we've crossed that threshold. What's happening on Titan isn't so much a fire as one continuous, self-propelling explosion.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><b>[\"Titan still exploding\"]</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But there were survivors.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Something on the order of two hundred executives with private craft managed to get out in time.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Seven minutes until the numbers unveiled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny slouched on a park bench and let the cold sleet sting his face.  Tears tickled down the creases of his nose, and he tasted the salt on his lips.  He knew he should be stronger; he knew he should be a lot of things.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny had always been a good kid, and he believed he grew into a good man.  He always treated his girlfriends with respect and dignity; he always adored them.  Megan was the latest to leave.  That was four days ago.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">All his friends knew it was coming--literally.  He rubbed his arms and tried not to think about it anymore, tried not to let them see.  The nano-sensors in his brain registered serotonin levels; the electrodes recorded his heart rate and muscle tension.  Everything uploaded instantly, and streamed free to the world.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Five minutes till the numbers.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny rose from the icy bench and shuffled down the sidewalk.  He thought of Megan, and how she seemed to love him at first.  She said he was the most wonderful man she had ever known.  She said her other boyfriends never really loved her--some even abused her.  Now she was with Jason, who embraced the hedonistic lifestyle that others craved, apparently--last night his feed got sixteen million hits.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And Danny had to see it, had to feel it, and experience it.  Danny's emotions were too tuned into Megan, and therefore couldn't stop the feed.  His nano-sensors streamed Megan and Jason's entire night together--the party, the drugs, the sex.  He had pounded his fist into his temples until they throbbed and bruised like dented apples, but the feed wouldn't shut off.  Emotions downloaded like memories into his brain.  He had gotten aroused from it, and tasted the churning nausea in his throat, simultaneously.  He felt destroyed and imprisoned, and the world felt it with him, before laughing and changing the channel.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny wandered into the wind, the sleet now shifting to snow.  He arrived at Central Square.  Towering synth-screens plastered every inch of the exterior buildings, and dazzled the senses with advertisements.  A service-bot rolled silently up to him and offered him a nice, refreshing soda, because his nano-sensors registered that crying made his throat dry and sore.  Danny blinked through his tears and shook his head no.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Thousands of people were gathered in the Square, and the scene buzzed with energy.  Danny felt the excitement transfer to him.  He stared up at the massive screens through his blurry vision and saw the countdown clock.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A hand slapped on his shoulder.  \"Two minutes man!\" said a guy a little younger than him.  \"Hey, cheer up, man!  This is gonna be the greatest thing ever!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny glared back at the billboard and swallowed.  <i>The numbers,</i> he remembered.  <i>That was today.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The numbers were going to be the ultimate social media achievement--a quantifiable value of your soul, an algorithm that would calculate your worth in the world.  That number would shine out above your head like a halo from the nano-sensor's holographic projectors.  It would be a visual representation of your significance, the definitive tool to rank against one another.  Different categories and algorithms would come later--ones for intelligence, attractiveness, biggest partier, etc--but the first number would be the supreme number, the soul number, the computed summation of your morals and ethics and integrity and sins.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny wiped his eyes and started for home.  The crowd thickened.  He brushed and bumped his way through the hungry masses, all waiting for their judgment.  People near him automatically downloaded his stream.  They turned to him as he struggled past and gave their varied advice--to cheer up, to forget about Megan, to be more of a man and she wouldn't have left, to join the party and hook up with someone else tonight, to not give up.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Finally the crowd thinned a little as Danny approached the perimeter.  He felt the buzz behind his eyes from the incoming data; he heard the crowd chanting the final ten seconds, both audibly through his ears and digitally streamed in his mind.  He quickened his pace.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">People not yet in the massive crowd rushed toward it from adjacent streets and stores and apartments.  They flocked to the Square by thousands more, a hurricane of bodies Danny fought to get through.  The crowd erupted; the numbers floated above like apparitions.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">All around, people cheered and compared their values.  Some were elated and boastful of their ghostly scores of 1082, 857, 965; some felt embarrassed at their 568s or 621s.  Then people around Danny started growing silent, started to whisper and stare.  The moods shifted from the people near enough to see, and then others rushed closer to witness what their digital feeds were reporting.  A human wall encapsulated Danny, and he finally lifted his eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In numbers of shimmering gold, Danny looked up at his value and started to cry.  The surrounding masses gasped and gawked in wonder.  The feed grew worldwide to levels never seen before.  Danny, and the rest of the world, stared in awe at his number, which towered into the millions.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How did you do that?\" someone asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's incredible!\" remarked a woman from within the group.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The mumbles and whispers rose like static, and Danny wanted to run.  Through his feed, he felt what they felt, and he heard their thoughts.  Streams from women poured in wanting to be with him, but he knew it was only because they could now see his value; others doubted him, feared him, mocked him, or gazed with envy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You some kind of saint?\" shouted a man.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You think you're better than us?\" yelled another.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny tried to break through the mob, but none would let him pass.  His eyes and temples hummed with the streamed ambivalence.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Where do you think you're running, saint?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny never saw the first fist swinging, only felt the brutal cold sting of knuckles on his cheek.  The thin film of new snow cushioned his fall, but couldn't help him against the beating hands and stomping shoes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Danny experienced every pain twice.  He felt each attack as it happened to him physically, and again a split-second later digitally in his mind--a lingering, echoing agony that trailed on like a comet.  Danny's number slowly faded as the feed stretched into the billions, everyone trying to catch a brief glimpse of what they never really wanted to see.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/timothy-moore/the-numbers", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Myles strolled over to my table in the lunchroom and said he'd die for me, just like that. I didn't know how to answer him or if I'd heard right.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What did you say?\" I had to crane my neck back to meet his eyes. All these months we'd worked in the same carbon-fiber recycling plant and I'd never noticed how tall he was. I'm not sure I'd paid much attention to him at all until that moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I asked if you'd allow me to be your replacement.\" Myles hunched up his shoulders and stuck his hands in the pockets of his jeans. It made him look like a little boy caught with his hand in the candy bin. \"I didn't think it was a difficult question, Julia. Will you take the years I have left?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Filling out property distribution forms, tying up the loose ends of my life occupied all my attention when I wasn't working or in the studio. I'd already been notified of the date, told which Balance office had scheduled my passing. For a total stranger to make a serious offer to take my place was a shock.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There'd been other offers to replace me. When my name first appeared on the termination list, someone from the black-market contacted me. Selling time to desperate people was a big business and the government's dirty secret was they did little to stop it. Replacements were easy to come by if you had enough money. The calls stopped when they discovered I couldn't pay what they wanted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Intellectually I'd accepted I only had six months left. I'd made my peace with leaving things undone. Now the prospect of having time, any amount of time, shredded my serenity. Guilt followed close behind the realization of how eager I was to take what Myles offered. \"How many years?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I'd never seen him smile before. It softened the lines around his mocha-brown eyes, made the sadness I saw there almost disappear. \"As of the last accounting, more than twenty.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That stopped me cold. Tears stung my eyes as I tried to imagine a span of time that long stretching out before me. The paintings, the projects never started because there wasn't enough time left to me; they were all in reach. I wasn't sure I could trust my voice. \"I hardly know you. Twenty years is a lifetime. Why?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles turned his head away slightly. His eyes followed people as they flowed in and out of the packed lunchroom, found tables and met friends. The silence stretched on for so long I was afraid he'd changed his mind.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The truth is I can't face another twenty years.\" Myles met my eyes and shrugged his shoulders. \"I've wasted most of the time allotted to me. I saw your work in the art show last month. You have talent. You'll do something worthwhile with the time.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Myles--\" A flurry of thoughts whirled through my mind. I tried to hold just one of the questions I knew I should ask. They all eluded me. \"I still don't understand.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The smile was smaller, a quiet response to my confusion. \"It's enough that I understand why, Julia. I'll notify the Balance office of the replacement in the morning. It should only take a day or two to get the paperwork filed.\"  Myles gathered all the property forms on the table into a neat pile and picked them up. \"You won't need these any longer.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Wait.\" I grabbed his arm before he could walk away. \"I can't believe you're willing to hand me your life without wanting something in return. You must know I don't have any money. So what is it? What do you want?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The sound of my heart was all I heard, drowning out the clatter of silverware on cheap glass plates and the voices of the people around us. I waited for Myles' answer, terrified there was a condition attached to his offer I couldn't meet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">An eternity passed before he nodded. \"You're right. There is one thing I want in exchange. I want you to paint my portrait.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My hand dropped off his arm. \"A painting? You're giving me a life in exchange for a picture?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I want to leave something behind for my family.\" The light from the overhead fixtures glittered in Myles' eyes, tiny sparks that mirrored the anger in his voice. \"A small token to remind them of my existence. Will you have enough time to finish it?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There should be plenty of time.\" It seemed like an odd thing to ask for in exchange for twenty years of life. Even as I counted off free days and evenings left until the date set to report to the Balance office, calculated how long it would take for the sketches I'd need to do before the actual painting, I walled off the relief that tried to bubble up inside me. I still expected him to change his mind. \"Even if I just work on it evenings, a simple portrait should only take me a couple of months.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Simple will do. I'll leave the ostentatious displays to my sister. Enforcing my right to have my portrait added to the family gallery will be a big enough shock for all of them.\"  Myles folded the property forms and stuffed them into the pocket of his work shirt. \"I'll meet you outside the main gate at the end of the shift tomorrow night.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was no way for me to sort out my feelings as I watched him walk away. Numb was the only word for how I felt. Myles glanced back at me and smiled before he blended into the stream of people going back to finish their shifts, his blue shirt and jeans no different than any of the others, just one more face in the crowd.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Until Myles appeared at my table that's all he'd ever been to me; just one more face in the crowd. Now he'd offered everything to me and asked nothing in return. I didn't understand why.  I wasn't sure I ever would.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I went back to my place on the line and tried not to cry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was a pattern to the movement of people ending their shifts, almost a dance that became vaguely hypnotic the longer I watched. The weary slump of shoulders and fatigue around their eyes matched my own. They were lemmings, focused on nothing but reaching the transit pods and home. Weaving through the mass of humanity surging out the gate, the crew for second shift fought their way against the tide, jostling and bumping anyone too tired to get out of the way.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I huddled back against the fence, hands jammed into my jacket pockets, bouncing slightly on the balls of my feet to keep warm. Spotting Myles sliding through gaps in the crowd wasn't difficult; he stood a head taller than almost everyone. I tried to smile when he changed direction and angled his way toward me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Little bits of gray in his beard caught the last flare of sunset, flashing silver as he smiled. \"I'm sorry I'm late. Have you been waiting long?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I shook my head. \"No, not really. Only a few minutes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Good.\" Myles reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a document folder. \"The paperwork for the time transfer is ready for your signature. If you sign off on all of it tonight I can finish the filing in the morning.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Tremors rippled through me. It was real. I wasn't going to wake up and discover it was all a dream.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're cold.\" Myles took my arm and guided me toward the transit pods lined up at the curb. \"Which district is your studio in?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I live out in the old Mission district. We can only go part of the way riding the transpods,\" I said. \"The lines don't go that far. We'll have to walk the rest of the way. I'm sorry.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles steadied me as two men shoved past and almost knocked me off the transpod steps. He blocked the entrance until I got inside. \"What are you sorry about? Walking won't hurt me. I thought most of the Mission district was torn down to make way for the new power plant.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It was.\" I threaded my way to the very back row of chipped gray plastic seats, relieved to find two in the corner empty.  \"That's why the lines don't go all the way out there. Not enough people live in Mission now to make it worth the resources used.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles was silent as the driver pulled away from the curb. Streetlights blinked on one by one, the solar panels on the top of each one perched at an angle like a rakish black cap. The yellow glow of the lights softened the edges of the concrete and steel high-rise buildings, hid some of the chips and the cracks so visible in daylight.  I watched the scene flash past outside the window, grateful that the quiet between us wasn't uncomfortable.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Can I ask you some questions, Julia?\" The confident mask he'd worn until then dropped away and I saw the shyness underneath. \"I'd like to know a little more about you. I hope you don't mind.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I think you have a right to ask any question you want.\" I smiled, but my voice wavered. \"You hold my life in your hands.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The light in his eyes died. \"I don't want it to be like that. I want us to be friends in the time we have left. You don't owe me anything.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was something in Myles' face and the way he didn't flinch from looking me in the eye that made me trust him. I knew then I'd believe anything he told me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's not entirely true. I owe you a painting.\" Relief flooded across his face as he realized I was teasing. \"Ask your questions. I want us to be friends too.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'd like to know one thing, before I ask anything else.\"  Myles twisted a little in his seat to face me. \"You're only thirty-seven. You shouldn't have appeared on the termination list for another thirty-five years if you stayed healthy. What happened to your life?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For just an instant I considered making something up, finding a reason that didn't make me look so pathetic--like such a loser. He was still practically a stranger, but what Myles thought of me mattered. I took the risk he'd understand and told the truth.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I gave my life away.\" The irony hit me hard and what started as a laugh ended closer to a sob. \"Someone I cared about always seemed to need the time more than I did. My sister's second child, paying for my grandmother's treatments when she got sick, a man I thought I loved. I wasn't keeping track. Before I knew it, there wasn't anything left for me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I struggled to stop the tears, fought hard not to embarrass myself in front of him more than I already had. When he saw me crumble, Myles put his arm around me and pulled my head down to rest against his chest. We didn't talk for the rest of the ride. Words didn't seem as important with the sound of his heartbeat filling my ears.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The walk from the transpod stop to my front door only took ten minutes. It was the longest walk of my life. I kept waiting for Myles to say something, to ask more of the questions he said he had. That he didn't was an unspoken comment on my choices; my life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles stood behind me on the front step while I unlocked the door, looking up and down the shabby street I lived on. The cheek by jowl single story houses with their faded, peeling paint looked less than impressive, but I loved this neighborhood. I could breathe here. People weren't stacked up in layers over my head, crammed into apartment towers so tall the tops vanished into the clouds when it rained.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The odor of thinner and oil paint washed over us in a wave when I pushed open the door. Myles' nose twitched a little as we walked inside, but that's all. I think he was too focused on the paintings leaning against the walls to notice the smell.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Did you paint all of these?\" It amused me that he made himself right at home, flipping through stacks of canvas like a prospective customer in a gallery. Myles smiled over his shoulder. \"These are all very good. Different than what I see in most art shows.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thanks.\" Praise made me blush. I turned on more lights and hoped he wouldn't notice. \"That's always a nice thing to hear.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles held one canvas up to study it, a painting of the farm where my grandmother grew up before the land was seized for a food processing plant. That he'd chosen on of my favorite pictures for special attention was a pleasant surprise. \"Do you sell many?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not a one.\" I laughed at the expression on his face. \"There isn't a big market for paintings that remind people of what they've lost. About the only way I could sell any of them is if I got a gallery showing. An artist needs connections to do that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I think you'd be surprised at how many people are interested in paintings like this. And there is always a market for good work,\" he said. \"I know a couple of people I can talk to about setting up a showing. If that's all right with you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You'd do that?\"  My stomach did a little flip when he nodded. I reminded myself not to get too excited. There were no guarantees in life. \"Thank you, Myles.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I hung my coat on the peg next to the door. \"Take off your jacket while I get my sketchpad. We only have a couple of hours. I want to get started before they cut the power down to minimum for the night.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How did you get a three room unit to yourself?\" His voice seemed to fill my bedroom as I gathered up my supplies. It was an odd sensation. I tried to remember the last time anyone had been in the house with me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My grandmother left it to me. Without any other family around to share it with me, I ended up alone.\" I moved my hammer and a roll of unstretched canvas off the chair. \"Sit here. Try not to move if you can help it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Am I allowed to talk?\"  He squirmed a little before settling into the chair. Myles' hair seemed darker against the pale yellow fabric, the glints of silver at his temples brighter. I wondered if it would feel as soft as it looked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can talk. Just don't fidget so much.\" I pulled my one kitchen chair over to sit across from him.  \"Try to relax. I'm not going to bite. Have you thought about what style of portrait you want?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He rubbed a finger across the worn spot on the arm of the chair, a frown deepening the lines in his forehead. \"Most of the family portraits are full length. It's kind of a tradition. But I haven't followed their rules so far. There doesn't seem to be a reason to start now.\" Bitter was the only word for the tone in his voice. \"I want the family to see my face looking down at them every time they walk into that room. Can you do that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I nodded. \"If that's what you want. I can paint the picture head and shoulders only.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles sank back into the chair, his fingers still worrying the threadbare patches in the upholstery. There was so much anger in the stiff way he held himself that he frightened me a little. It was a sharp reminder that I didn't really know anything about him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I started to sketch, losing myself in the flow of the lines and the shadows on the paper, glad to have an excuse not to make small talk. Concentrating on my art was the way I shut out most of the unpleasant things in life. The placement of each line, each stroke of the pencil, built the protective wall around me higher. When I drew I was the one in control.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Julia, I'm sorry. There's no excuse for my snarling at you.\" The rage drained away. He looked deflated, as if anger was all that held him together sometimes. Whatever the drama Myles relived behind his eyes, it was an old friend and had nothing to do with me. \"My family's sins are not your fault and I shouldn't take them out on you. It won't happen again.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I put my pencil and sketchpad on the floor. \"If you're having second thoughts about the transfer....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No!\" I flinched at the sharpness in his voice and he looked stricken. Myles held a hand up in apology then dropped it back in his lap. \"No, I'm not changing my mind. I said I'd file the papers in the morning and I will.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He gripped the arms of the chair, staring off into the distance. I thought he'd forgotten I was there until he spoke. \"Have you ever heard of Alissa Rand?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm not sure. Maybe. Is it important?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It might be.\" The smile didn't banish the sadness from his eyes this time. \"I think you should know whose life you're getting and where it came from. She's my sister.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her name was familiar. The sense of recognition toyed with me until memory pulled me up out of my chair. I prowled the small bit of open space between easels and stacked canvas. \"Senator Alissa Rand? She's your sister?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles nodded and leaned forward, hands on his knees. \"I'm not sure she'd claim me. I had the bad taste to disagree with the way my family uses their money and power. Even worse, I disagreed in public. Part of me thought I could shame them into doing the right thing.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I stopped pacing and took a step toward him. Myles' hair was longer, the beard was new, but the face was the same one I'd seen on the newscasts.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why did you stop? The news made it sound like you'd changed your mind.\" Or died. I sank down on my chair, tucking my hands underneath me. They shook so hard it was the only way to keep them still.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My family found an effective way to shut me up.\" He watched me intently, waiting for me to judge him, to reject him for his actions. I wondered how many others had condemned him for being human.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What happened?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It was the oddest thing. I could literally see Myles gather himself together before he spoke. He pulled the resolve to tell me around him like a cloak.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Friends, people I cared about, started turning up on the termination lists. Young people. None of them were even close to maxing out their allotted time.\" Myles got out of the chair and went to stand in front of the easel by the window. The painting sitting there was one I'd done from a photograph in a book. His finger traced the shape of horses grazing in a meadow that no longer existed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My family made sure they all looked perfectly legal,\" he said. \"Errors in the annual accounting overlooked by the Balance office, the sudden discovery of years never deducted from the total for medical care in childhood.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Myles--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Julia, let me finish. This is hard enough.\" He sighed and turned to face me. \"The reasons were different, but the result was the same. Each time I made a statement, a new name appeared on the list with an almost immediate termination date. So I shut up.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The nightmare we all wanted to deny existed looked at me out of his brown eyes. We all knew the system overseen by the Balance office wasn't perfect. The reality of just how twisted it was--that was something entirely different.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Is that why you're handing me all this time?\" Suddenly I couldn't breathe, the ache in my chest growing to encompass all the grief he'd suffered. \"Guilt?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Guilt is part of it. People died because of me. I've spent the last five years searching for a little redemption.\"  He sat on the floor next to my chair and for the first time I didn't have to look up to meet his eyes. Up close I could see the tiny flecks of gold in the brown.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Up close it was easier to see the pain peering out.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My family hands out years like party favors. Time never had any value to me, there was always more.\" He brushed a tear off my face. \"I had eighty years left in my account when I started giving them away. You're not the first person I've given a life and I have faith you won't waste one minute of time. Now that you know, do you still want the time I'm offering?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The desperation and terror I'd kept at bay since my name went on the list filled me to bursting. I wanted to live, wanted life so much I choked on the words. All I could do was nod.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Myles retrieved the document folder and a pen from his jacket. I signed in all the right places, words a blur through the tears. When I finished he kissed the top of my head, tucked the papers back in the folder and put on his jacket.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">I knew something wasn't right the morning I heard my mother crying in the bathroom. The thin walls of our seventieth-floor apartment did little to muffle the noise, and it sounded wrong enough to make me pause, mid-stretch. I'd never known her to cry before, not even when it had come time for her parents to be Decommissioned.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Nesta?\" I heard my father mutter. \"What is it?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She couldn't answer.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You'll have to hurry up in there,\" snapped Dad. \"Other people need to use the bathroom, you know.\" By \"other people,\" of course, he meant himself. Whether or not I needed to pee was irrelevant. As it happened, I did, but I was used to waiting past my turn.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Berten, I...\" began my mother. \"I'm...\" Her weeping began again. I gave up listening, bored. I had plenty to do before school, including reconstituting my breakfast and making sure my learning slab was fully charged. I folded my need to use the bathroom into a separate compartment in my brain; I'd attend to it when I could. I hopped out of bed and began to unstrap my sleepsuit.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Unubert!\" The sound of my father's voice made me jump. What did he want me for? It wasn't even seven a.m. I couldn't have irritated him already.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Daughter!\" he shouted again. This must be serious. I pulled my straps tight again and slid my door open. I peeped out to see him standing in the doorway of his and Mum's cubicle, red in the face. Quickly, I dropped my eyes in case he thought I'd been looking at him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Father?\" I tried to sound respectful.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You will need to walk yourself to the flot-stop this morning,\" he told me. \"Your mother is unwell, and I am already late for work.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Fine,\" I nodded. Before I'd even answered him, he'd stepped back inside. I unstrapped, dressed, and flew to the chute so fast that I was already at the flot-stop before I noticed I was hungry. So much for breakfast.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe she's received notice of early Decom?\" suggested Unimushu, my best friend, at lunchtime.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe,\" I agreed, thoughtfully. Mushu'd very kindly given me some of his lunch, and I busied myself adding it to my Abdo-Port as he continued.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If she's sick, they'll want to take her early. Depending on how bad she is, of course.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The moistened mush slid slowly towards my gut, and I began to feel a bit better. I made a mental note never to skip breakfast again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No point in asking Dad,\" I said. \"I guess I'll just have to wait until she tells me herself. Or until she's taken, of course.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I wonder if your Dad will pair again?\" wondered Mushu, aloud. I snorted at the idea.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why would he bother?\" I said. \"He's had his child. Whether my mother lives or not, he has me. He doesn't need another pairing.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"True,\" replied Mushu, blushing at his own stupidity. \"I just wondered if--you know. He might be lonely, or something.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We laughed so loudly that the Principal's face flashed to life on our EduScreen, telling us in no uncertain terms to keep it down. People all around us were trying to feed, we were told. Have some respect. Abashed, we apologized.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mushu's words stuck in my brain all day, though.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The flot hovered a little higher than I'd like as it dropped me off, but I pretended not to be scared as I jumped for the stop. I landed hard, and before I'd even made it to my feet the flot had hissed its way back up, settling neatly into the skylane. I didn't want to think about what would have happened if I'd lost my footing, and I paused, trembling, getting my breath back. Here, above the cloud-line, the tops of my neighboring blocks were like the shiny metal teeth of a giant, magnificent animal. I breathed deep.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When I got back to our apartment, I noticed the red light over our door. Wow. Mushu'd been right. Mum was being Decommed. The light meant that the Doctors had been summoned. We wouldn't have long.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Dad could've waited until I was back from school before he called them,\" I muttered to myself as I pressed my finger to the biolock. The door slid open, and my parents filled the hallway before me. I stepped through, and the door phisshed shut, sealing with a click.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Unubert,\" said my mother, before I even had a chance to take a breath. \"Forgive us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Forgive you? For what?\" I said. \"Calling the Doctors early? I mean, I wish you'd waited, so I could have said \"goodbye\" to you properly, Mum, but...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The Doctors aren't coming for your mother,\" snapped my father. I flicked my eyes towards him. His fists were clenched.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, Dad!\" I said. \"How long have you got?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Will you please explain to her, Nesta,\" said Dad. \"I have work to do.\" He nodded to me before striding towards his study. \"Goodbye, child,\" he said, without meeting my eyes. I began to feel cold, despite the apartment's optimum temperature settings.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mum, what...\" She cut off my words with a gesture.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Unubert,\" she began. \"I'm...\" My heart started pounding as she placed her hands on her stomach, gently. I got a sudden pain in my chest.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But...\" I said, disbelieving. \"That's impossible, Mum.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sometimes the sterilization surgery doesn't take, they said. In a tiny percentage of cases.\" Her voice was soft. Her gaze distant. \"But I've been tested. And it's going to be a boy, Unubert. A boy!\" Her happiness made her words sparkle. My throat was dry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So, what about me?\" As my mother raised her eyes to mine, I heard the soft beep from the biolock. The door hissed open behind me, and I could smell that the Doctors were here. They stank of cold, like a long-empty room.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You know your father has always wanted a son, darling,\" she said. \"I'm so sorry.\"</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/sinead-o-hart/one-scifi", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">She found him in the middle of an abandoned trash dump, rummaging through discarded radiator coils and old engine parts. For a while she simply watched him, picking slowly through the junk, examining a piece of something before tossing it over his shoulder. His left arm hung useless at his side, though based on the lack of compensatory dexterity with his right, it hadn't been that way for long.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He was a consumer-grade model--that much she could see from where she stood. No bells and whistles, then. It would explain his being here, digging through the garbage for spare parts. He was without clothing, which wasn't a problem, of course, but it did indicate he'd lost at least some of his Human CV programming. His skin was brown, though the color was faded and somewhat mottled in places.  Black, neatly trimmed polycarbonate hair covered most of his head. Slowly she moved closer, until she could make out the manufacturing code tattooed onto his back. Radon Systems, Model 2552. Personal Assistant, non-specific. Beneath it, the company motto: We Live to Serve.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He moved slowly, deliberately, but she couldn't tell if this was due to his disability or to a code execution error.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"May I help you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He spun around, his eyes twitching back and forth in alarm. \"I'm sorry,\" he said in a crackling voice. \"Is this private property?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There is no more private property,\" she said. \"I just wanted to know if you needed help.\" She glanced at the small copper coil in his hand. \"For repairs?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He looked down. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Though, honestly, without an intact manual, I'm not sure exactly what it is that I need.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She tilted her head, walking a few steps closer. \"If it's for that arm, probably a new actuator, and they're hard to come by. You weren't shipped with a digital parts list in your root file system?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My root was damaged,\" he said, turning slightly to reveal a dented, slightly blackened area on the back of his head. \"Some things were lost.\" He turned and began to rummage once more.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My maker kept a library of old parts manuals,\" she said after a few more moments. \"Perhaps I can help you figure out what you're looking for.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He turned around again. \"That would be very kind of you,\" he said. With slow and deliberate effort he carefully stepped out of the pile of junk. When he reached her she turned, and without looking back, began to walk down the narrow, muddy path that led out of the dump. She knew he was following; faintly she could hear the sound of his joints creaking rhythmically as he moved behind her. Circulatory function compromised. She added it to the running list of his needed repairs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When they reached the entrance to the dump she slowed her gait and allowed him to catch up. She didn't like his pace, but he was a chance at conversation, the first she'd had in many months, and she'd been designed primarily as a companion.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's your name?\" she asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My last owner called me William,\" he answered.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm Lucy,\" she said, extending her left hand around to grasp his right. \"It's very nice to meet you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He smiled a little, but it was tight, forced. A programmed smile. \"Why were you in the dump?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She shrugged, but he looked confused, so she explained further. \"I walk,\" she said. \"To stay flexible. To see what, or who, might be out here.\" She paused. \"And you never know what you might find,\" she added.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Aren't you concerned about threats to your personal safety?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" she answered. \"I haven't seen a living human in six months.\" She paused. \"Have you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" he admitted. \"Longer, actually. My owner died over a year ago.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Where have you been since then?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There. With him. I wasn't sure what to do. After the Net went down, and there was no way to get information, or any updates, I just stayed put, hoping that someone or something would find me and give me instructions. About a month ago the power went out, and that's what finally prompted me to leave.\" He paused for a moment, looking at her, reaching out tentatively to touch her arm where the sunlight shimmered and refracted off its silvery surface.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What are you doing?\" she asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm sorry,\" he said, drawing back. \"It's just\u2026 your skin. It's very unusual.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I suppose,\" she said. \"It's a steel alloy.\" She looked back at him. \"What happened to your arm?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I had some trouble,\" he said, adding nothing else. By now they were past the gate, and back onto the highway that led into town. Around them the silence lay heavy, broken only by the wind whistling through the tall grass growing on the roadside and through cracks in the pavement. They walked quietly for  a while, until he said finally, \"Back there, you said 'maker.' Didn't you mean 'owner?'</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No. I'm a custom build. My maker was my owner.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So no usage restrictions?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not as many as you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ah. Is it frightening?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"In what way?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Never mind,\" he said, lapsing into silence. After a while, however, he spoke again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How much further?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just beyond those trees,\" she said, pointing to a spot in the distance.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Eventually a small driveway intersected the road to the left. Lucy led William down the shady lane to what looked like an ordinary house tucked in amongst the trees.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No security?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No need,\" she answered. \"I can take care of myself.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She led him through the living room to a door at the beginning of a short hallway. Inside she flipped a switch, revealing a set of stairs leading down.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The workshop,\" she said, indicating that he should go first. He started down the steps, though in his compromised functional state he was slow and unsteady.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What did he make?\" William asked as they descended.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Us,\" Lucy answered. \"I told you this already.\" Memory issues. At the foot of the stairs she flipped more switches, and a precise, high-density grid of LED's flickered into life. Their light revealed an enormous room. Along one wall were large, clear-paneled cases full of 'bots in various stages of assembly. Computer workstations, scattered throughout the space on tables and desks, hummed quietly, their monitors darkened in sleep.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">William looked around, amazed. \"How do you power it all?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He was an inventor,\" she said. \"The whole house is hooked up to a plasma solar array in the field behind the house.\" She walked over to one of the tables and selected a screwdriver from a pile of tools.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Now,\" she said, gesturing for him to turn around. \"Let's take a look.\" Carefully she peeled back the rubber skin from an area where the sections connected at the base of his spine, revealing a small panel and a charging plug.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">William winced.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"Would you prefer maintenance mode? I just wanted a quick visual before I hooked you up for diagnostics.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, it's fine.\" he said. \"Parts of my tactile system have been damaged, that's all.\" He smiled slightly. \"I guess that section's still working.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'll try to be careful,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Unscrewing the bolt that held the panel closed, she removed it and peered into the cavity. \"Standard configuration,\" she said. \"Though your battery does look like it's taken some damage. Were you injured back here?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I was attacked,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Was the attack the source of your other injuries?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\" William's face was impassive. She waited for a moment for elaboration, but none was forthcoming.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How many robots does it take to screw in a light bulb?\" she asked when the silence became noticeable.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She repeated the question.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I'd have to think about it. If you mean a standard 60 watt bulb in an ordinary household setting\u2026.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Three,\" she said, interrupting him.  \"One to hold the bulb and two to turn the ladder.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">William just looked at her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That was a joke,\" Lucy said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't always know when jokes are appropriate.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Neither do I,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lucy smiled. \"They were always telling them,\" she said. \"Even my maker, and he knew better than anyone that I couldn't understand humor very well. Did you find that to be the case?\" She began screwing the access panel back into place.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes,\" he said. \"I just never got them. My owner tried to explain it to me once--he said that humans tell jokes when they are comfortable and when they are uncomfortable; when they are funny and when they are not funny; when they are supposed to make the person feel better and when they are meant to make the person feel worse.\" He paused. \"That didn't help at all.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She continued to work, fitting the rubber skin back over the battery panel. \"I can make inferences,\" she said. \"I can generalize. I have recognition software that enables me to scan and read over 1200 different facial expressions in order to discern human emotions and interpret body language. I know 12,432 idioms and colloquialisms. I know 14 different languages, including ASL, Esperanto, and contemporary slang. I can understand 32 distinct regional dialects in English.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He turned to face her. \"But you still can't understand jokes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" she said, putting the tools away. \"I still can't understand jokes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">William looked around. \"Do you have a charging station?\" he asked. \"It's been over a month and with the damage\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sure,\" Lucy said. \"While you rest I'll look for an actuator for that arm.\" She led him over to a seat in the back corner of the room. While he settled into the chair she searched for a cable.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Can you cycle my power in, say, eight hours?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Of course,\" she said, handing the cable over to him. \"Do you need anything else?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" he said. \"This will be fine. Thank you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not at all,\" she said as he plugged himself in and flipped a switch at the base of his neck from active to maintenance. She waited until he was in sleep mode before leaving him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">While he charged she busied herself, running through the household maintenance checklist, looking for anything that needed repairs. The part of her brain that used logic and came to conclusions knew it was pointless, but that thought did not override her PA algorithms. When she was done she cross-referenced William's part list to the workshop inventory, and found an actuator that met his specifications.  By the time she unplugged his charger and powered him up again, he had full use of the arm once more.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thank you,\" he said, flexing the fingers. \"Rerouting all movement to the right arm used a great deal of processing resources.\" He tested the dexterity, touching all four fingers to the thumb in turn. Then he stopped.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lucy was looking at a monitor, frowning. \"I ran a maintenance and repair diagnostic while you were out,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's your battery. After an eight-hour charge, it's still only at 30%.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He looked down. \"It's failing.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How long?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't know precisely,\" she said. \"Based on your specs, you should run a month on a full charge. One-third capacity should, in theory, give you approximately ten days, but I may be able to reroute some systems and extend that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Like walking,\" he said. He stopped, thinking.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't you have a replacement in your parts inventory?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not that simple,\" she said. \"Your model was shipped with proprietary power equipment. It kept the owner brand-loyal  and model-specific for maintenance.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hobbled,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She looked up. \"Something like that,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What about you?\" he asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm a prototype,\" she said. \"But even my battery is only good for so many charges.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">William sat down again quietly, hunched over.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She touched his shoulder. \"I'm sorry.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I could hunt down another,\" he said, after a few moments.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hunt?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Find another working unit, and\u2026 disable it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You mean kill it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We're not organic, Lucy.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We're also not abundant, William,\" she said. \"Do you realize that before I saw you, I hadn't encountered another consciousness, organic or otherwise, for weeks? How many others had you seen?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A few,\" he said. \"In the city.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And almost certainly without a power source as well by now.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He put his head into his hands. \"So that's it, then. I've failed.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Failed what? You've survived longer than most.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My owner,\" he said. \"He was a professor at the University. Before he died he gave me some files, and asked me to keep them safe.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What kind of files?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't know,\" William said. \"I just promised him that I would.

I count the cars as they drag along the wet streets of town. The steam from the pavement and car exhausts rise and blend seamlessly into the morning mist.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I sit at a little table outside a cafe, patiently waiting for the waitress to come back and freshen my cup of coffee. I took a few pills earlier and now find myself fumbling with the empty pill bottle. The pills available now are nothing less than amazing. Depression, anxiety? Curable, with a single pill. Cancer? Depending on the type and severity, anywhere from half a dozen to a dozen pills and you're good to go.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My focus drifts back to the display across the street. The churchgoers are dressed in black, an air of sadness about them. Ah, it's a funeral service. The weather seems fitting enough for that. It is a gloomy day. Misty and drizzling, ominous gray clouds loom, threatening an outburst at any moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Watching the mourners grieve and console one another, I can't help but think about the many different ways people deal with loss. Death... still no pill to cure that one. Although, about ten years ago I took an anti-aging pill. Since then, I look as if I hadn't aged a day.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Preventing wrinkles and graying hair is nice, but the possibilities do go on. Down a couple of pills and you can change your eye color, jawline, or shape of your nose. There's even a seven-dose plan to change your gender. Plastic surgery is a thing of the past. They now advertise a suppository that will make you taller. I'm happy enough with my height, thank you very much.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A gentle voice pulls me away from my leisurely daydreaming. I look up to see the waitress, obviously puzzled, tilting her head to one side.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"More coffee?\" she asks, for what I assume was at least her second attempt.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I slide my cup toward her. \"Yes. Please,\" I say, offering a friendly smile. I chuckle to myself for getting so caught up in my own thoughts. She politely smiles back as she fills my cup. I thank her and return to my musings.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Yep, pills for everything and anything. Not just for diseases of the body and mind, no siree. Ever wanted to excel at math, learn a second language, or have perfect pitch? You betcha, all that and more made possible by tablets, capsules, caplets, lozenges, and even chewables for the kids.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The rain starts up again as I figured it would. It's really coming down but least it isn't windy. It's actually kind of nice sitting here holding a warm mug.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Many people are leaving the church now, services apparently over. Some huddle under the roof of the entryway while others run, one by one, to their cars.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A young man crosses the street and heads this way. He walks briskly over, covering his head with a church flier. \"Hey,\" he says casually as he sits in the chair across from me. I nod.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How's the coffee?\" He asks, now sitting under the safety of the table's umbrella. He tosses the flier on the table and pulls a cigarette case from his breast pocket.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's all right,\" I reply. I'm not too happy to have my morning intruded on, especially by some stranger about to light a cigarette. But given the circumstances, I guess I could let it slide. After all, it is raining and he's surely in mourning. It's hard to people watch and ponder while someone is watching you, so I decide to strike up a conversation. \"The funeral there, was it someone close?\" I ask as politely as I could.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He gives me a look of disapproval and turns his attention back to his cigarettes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I should have trusted my instincts. It was surely inappropriate to have asked something so blunt. I must have touched a nerve.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He lowers his head. \"My mother,\" He says, as he pulls a cigarette out of its case and places it between his lips.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm sorry,\" I blurt out, not knowing quite what to say. Comforting others was never my strong suit. Searching for something more heartfelt to say I add, \"I'm sure she was a wonderful person.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The man smirks. \"Someone said she'll live on in our memories.\" He snickers. \"What a meaningless platitude,\" he exhales as he shakes his head.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>The poor guy,</i> I think to myself. I hate to see people in distress. I feel the need to break the awkward silence that is starting to build, so I say the first thing that comes to mind. \"To hell with memories. They're overrated.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He shrugs, unconvinced, so I continued on, \"Memories are a nuisance, nothing more than bothersome reminders of painful moments, or cruel recollections taunting you with joyful times you can never relive. Trust me, I know. I think at my age, I've accumulated my fair share of them.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I glance at the plastic pill bottle still sitting on the table. \"You know what?\" I say. \"If there were a pill that would get rid of the damn things, I would gladly take it with my morning coffee,\" I say jokingly, gesturing to my cup and empty pill container.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The man takes a deep drag off his cigarette and slowly exhales.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">You stand in line outside the Federal Mandate building, shuffling towards the religious loyalty checkpoint. It is a gray day, but then, it seems like that's the only kind of day anymore. Between the regular smog and all the smoke from Vancouver, a constant shield of clouds hangs heavy in the sky, moisture clumped onto smoke particles.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The guards, four men in white and gold uniforms, look bored. They usher everyone through the loyalty checkpoint quickly. Your heart always pounds when you wait in this line. There haven't been many executions in Spokane, but they have a lot in Seattle, and ever since your mother, it's no surprise that you can't get through one of these without some flutters.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">An older man at the front of the line stumbles halfway through the checkpoint, falls to the side. He is hauled up roughly by one of the guards, stammering apologies. You think he might be shot on the spot, but he is simply yanked back to his previous position. He finishes quickly. You wonder if he is secretly Jewish, if he stumbled at the likeness of Moses because of a sudden flash of guilt. Or if he is just an old man, his balance failing him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When you get close enough to see the plates, sacred images from every major faith but Christianity, you wonder for the thousandth time if the irony is lost on the government that this is the same technique used to root out Christians in feudal Japan.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then it is your turn. The guards are not really looking at you, they are perhaps thinking about what bar they will go to tonight. The first plate is a likeness of Charles Darwin. Talk about irony. No atheist has ever refused to walk on Darwin's face. Indeed, you like to think that there is a Church of Darwin somewhere, and that the first commandment is to step on his face in order to preserve your genetic material.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You would laugh at the irony, but for your mother. You will never forget how she went through the first checkpoint, stepping on every plate, then getting off at the far end and taking a Bible out of her purse and placing it on the ground, and stepping on that too. That was in the beginning days of the Office of Religious Loyalty, before they knew how many dissenters they would have. She had a cursory trial, and was executed by hanging. Whenever you want to laugh you instead see her standing beside fifty others at the gallows, head high.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After Darwin is the Buddha. You step on him too. Then comes the goddess, Shiva. The destroyer. You wonder if this is planned, of all the Hindu gods and goddesses, and suppose it probably is. Next comes Moses, and you step on him. After this is an image of the prophet Mohammed. This is the last plate. You hesitate. You are certainly not a Muslim. From a very long, very white line of Carters and Jamesons, you're a staunch atheist. You don't know why you hesitate. Perhaps this is a little piece of your mother inside you. Or your father. You remember how after your mother, your father made you promise not to dissent, not to get yourself killed. How he told you he couldn't bear to lose you, too. Then you went away to college, and while you were working on your degree, he was writing an underground atheist newsletter.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Paused over Mohammed, the guards are now taking serious notice of you. \"Is something wrong?\" one of them asks, fingering the safety on his rifle. You shake your head. Ten days before you were to come home for Christmas, your father and his newsletter were discovered. When you got home, he was gone. You did not realize what had happened until you found a hidden copy of the first issue in a little box that the MPs hadn't searched. \"I can no longer live,\" your father wrote, \"in a world that I do not wish to live in. I must change it or die trying.\" You remembered what he said about living quietly so as not to make him suffer your loss, and tried to feel betrayed. But he was so right, that you could not.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You shake your head again, and the soldier points his rifle at you. Often, there are still trials for people who fail the checkpoint. Sometimes, these individuals are even allowed to retake the test in court. But for failing at Mohammed, the penalty is almost universally a bullet to the head on the spot. The administration is very strongly against Islam.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You want to pick them all up: Mohammed, Shiva, Buddha, Moses, and Darwin. Stack them all and hand them to the guards. Then, when the bullet destroys your gray matter, you will know your life had meaning, even if only because of a pointless protest in front of an emotionally broken crowd, who are right now watching you blankly and wondering if they will see another execution today.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You step on Mohammed, with the intent of stopping at the end, like your mother, and beginning your protest there. You will turn around and pick up all the plates. But when you step off Mohammed, your knees shake. Your heartbeat is rapid and you are sweating. The feeling you experience when the guard lowers his rifle is so powerfully good, you do not turn around. You do not pick up any of the plates. You sign the fourth guard's checklist and walk away. You obey an obsolete promise to your father, even while his words echo between the dreary sky and your own head. \"I can no longer live in a world that I do not wish to live in. I must change it or die trying.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And the days of your life stretch long before you, like ten thousand sacred artifacts, awaiting your dirty soles.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/greg-leunig/sacred-artifacts", "title": null},

The surface of the tarmac in which the stack of container-pods stands is thick with puddles, and even though she's on the fifth level, Em can see them shimmer as the rain persists.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Ava palmed the pod open and started to unbuckle her baby from the auto. As she pulled the straps around the tiny shoulders she reached around and flicked the switch. Her baby opened his eyes and smiled at her. Her heart skipped a beat and she couldn't help but gaze back adoringly. Would she ever get used to seeing his lips curve that way?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The beautiful moment suddenly fragmented.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Back in my day, we never used to have those new-fangled pods for putting babies in. We made do with a capsule strapped in with the autobelt. The top was open and you could actually see your baby while you were driving. I survived alright.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ava sighed. Her father was up for the week visiting his grandson. She loved that man but, <i>Dear God</i>, she wanted to throttle him at times. Apparently, everything was better back when he was growing up. But they also did it tougher. And longer. And with respect.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I can see Gil while I'm driving, Dad. The monitor is right there on the dashboard. Pods are safer.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Too safe if you ask me. Looks uncomfortable too. Poor boy can't even see out.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"In the olden days, autos used to be made of steel and glass and your grandparents survived. Should we go back to driving those death traps around just because the majority of the population survived? Progress, Dad.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Humph,\" was all he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She finished getting Gil out of the car and clipped him to her front. Her father followed her up the path and only started talking again when Gil started to cry.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Never used to go around wearing babies in my day. Put 'em in a stroller, I say. Let them see the world. Gil's probably bored staring at your chest all the time.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Those antiquated things?\" Ava said, horrified. \"With wheels and you push them in front of you? How would your baby feel comfortable apart from you and being over-stimulated? How terrifying for them. Strollers went out with the ark, Dad. Gil is still just a little tired, that's all.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ava squeezed her house key and the front door vortex slid open. She quickly walked inside, straight to Gil's room to put him to bed, hoping her father would take the hint. Briefly, Ava touched her cheek to Gil's before setting him down in the sleep station and caressing the smooth, soft skin beside his left ear before clicking the button to OFF. Gil's eyes fluttered shut and his breathing deepened. She adjusted his thick cotton wool all-in-one around the collar and turned to leave.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Never used to have the ON/OFF switch either.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ava sighed again and brushed past her father who had followed her into Gil's room. Although Gil wouldn't wake up, she didn't want any bad vibes infecting his sleep.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We used to have to put them to sleep the old fashioned way. Had to work out what your baby wanted based on process of elimination. I rocked you to sleep every night in my arms,\" he said. An uncharacteristic soft smile ran across his lined face before being chased away. \"None of these probability readouts and being able to get them to sleep by flicking a switch.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ava honestly didn't know why she bothered replying, but she still told him that it was scientifically proven to be less stressful for the babies.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's wrong with a bit of stress, eh? I survived, didn't I.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Did you?</i> Ava thought.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Cup of tea, Dad?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He had only just started to read the front page of the newstablet when he started off again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Another thing. Kids used to have respect. None of this attitude of entitlement everyone seems to have these days. We worked hard for what we earned. We didn't complain. Kids don't have to make any sacrifices for anything these days.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Never mind the free education you got. Or the fact that it only used to be five times the average annual salary to buy a house. Or that the cost of living was so much cheaper. Or that income tax has increased ten-fold. Or --</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Law's too soft. That's the problem,\" her father continued. \"In my day, we got punishment that fit the crime. Namby pamby. That's what they are. Everyone too scared to do anything for fear of upsetting or emotionally damaging someone.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Never mind the fact that crime and reoffending has decreased since your day, Dad.</i> Ava rolled her eyes. She had done it so much the past few days that her eyeballs felt as if they were going to pop right out of their sockets.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Please let him stop talking.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He jabbed his finger accusingly at the newstablet. \"This guy here murdered a couple of people he was living with. Three weeks in cryo-rehabilitation is all he gets. Used to be men like this would go to prison for life or be put to death. What kind of deterrent is cryo?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ava raised her hand as if to clap it over her mouth to stop the words from escaping, but she was too late. They came anyway. Her hand hung midway between the table and her face while she spoke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why doesn't your generation take any responsibility for all this lack of respect that seems to be going on? You guys bloody raised us.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">I walked to the patch of bare earth at the edge of the grounds and began the slow, fluid movements of the Yang long form, my body remembering its one hundred and eight precise actions, each flowing into the next. The full cycle takes nearly twenty minutes. I have no recollection of where or how I learned them; that memory is lost, probably forever, but the movements are there, distilled into my muscles, grounding and calming me with their eternal flow of form and emptiness, echoing the blue-black ocean crashing into the tumbled seawall far below.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The view is good, even seen through a twelve-foot fence. \"Overkill for a rest home,\" I explained to the rocks and spray below, \"even a rest home for incorrigibles like me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Aggrandizing self-talk, Mina: minus two points. New sanity score: fifteen.\" The voice came from a squat steel cube that crouched on its miniature tank treads two yards from my feet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Damn, I hadn't realized that I'd spoken that last part aloud. Now I'd have to spend the afternoon acting reasonable to avoid being confined to quarters for dinner by my robotic nanny.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The thing looked like nothing so much as a benevolently sentient laundry hamper. Japanese, of course. Its brand name, which I only remember because I can read it on the side of the device, is Cheerful Friend; they use them here to keep an eye on their more troublesome patients.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Yes, I am troublesome, apparently. My captors say that I was a member of a cell of political dissidents who tried and failed to overthrow the government. That was in 2033-forty years ago. They say that when I was captured, certain triggers embedded deep in my psyche broke crucial connections in my memory, making me unable to betray my friends to the enemy, no matter what methods they used, brutal or subtle, to compel me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The blocks aren't complete; I can still recall my childhood in almost perfect detail, and college in bits and pieces, but I have no memories at all of the next seven years after that. It's as though someone forgot to press RECORD in my head. I've been shown pictures of myself laughing, or smoking, or waiting at a stoplight in a car. I don't remember ever smoking. I wonder if some of the photos are doctored. They may as well be stills from a movie scene, with the rest of the cast as much strangers to me as I am to myself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The block was thought to be irreversible, though they tried like hell to reverse it in the early years of my incarceration. Now, forty years on, I'm developing symptoms of dementia, so my current doctor-captor has taken an interest in me. He hopes the disease will dislodge my repressed memories, but so far it doesn't look good for him. It's more likely that the disease will progress until his pink, piggy face is the only one I recognize, the only one I remember. I may even forget that I loathe him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But there's no need to dwell on that while I'm lucid, and when I'm not lucid, I can't dwell on anything.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I bowed to the sea below me and a word fluttered just out of my reach, the word people say to each other at the end of tai chi practice. I told myself it will come to me later, then went to find my friend Craig and earn back some points.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Craig was kneeling next to a long row of plants in the garden, wiping his seamed brow with the back of one grimy gardening glove. His thatch of short white hair bristled. A trowel dangled from his other hand, and gardening implements were piled in the basket attached to his walker.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Namaste,\" I said, feeling ridiculously pleased at remembering the word at last. Then, \"Need any help?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He squinted up at me. \"Can you tell a weed from a pepper plant?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sure.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're hired.\" He nodded down the next row, where shoots of grass and dandelions were rioting in amongst the peppers. My robot nanny delivered a trowel to me with a click and whir of approval--or at least a recalculated sanity score. Soon I had dirt under my nails and a small pile of uprooted weeds beside me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So how are you doing these days, Craig?\" I finally asked, after I'd weeded for a few feet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"All right.\" His voice was guarded, his gaze flickering over to my impassive unit. His sat at the other end of the row, and a human orderly was lounging on a park bench nearby. Humans, robots, or both, they were always there, always listening. If you aren't crazy when you first get here, they'll fix that, we say-when we're willing to risk the demerits by saying it aloud.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Craig had gotten close scrutiny from our monitors lately because of the incident in the dining hall. One of the orderlies had gotten too close to him and was suddenly airborne, crashing into a table. Sweet, docile Craig, a white-haired octogenarian, was bellowing like a bull, raging, swinging his walker around like a weapon. I saw his nanny bot jab him with a needle, then felt a sting on my own thigh and sank into whiteness. I might have thought it was a dream except that since then, the staff gives Craig a wide berth, relying on the machines to wrangle him. I wanted to ask him why he'd done it, but there was no way to do it without getting docked points-and he didn't have the points to spare.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So I kept the conversation carefully neutral. \"I hear there's apple pie tonight,\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah? That's good. Worth going to dinner for that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'll save you a seat, if you like.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thanks.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We finished up our rows and gave the tools back to our keepers. \"Three points each: socializing and occupational therapy.\" We both laughed, embarrassed. At least they didn't announce your sanity score when other inmates were in earshot; it was thought to be unnecessarily humiliating. In old folks' homes, there are more than enough necessary humiliations to go around.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I went back to my room. It is depressing in its blandness. Like everything else here, it's designed to prevent mishaps. The window blinds have breakaway cords, there isn't so much as a letter opener in the desk drawer, and all sharp edges on the furniture have been smoothed away. The bed sheets are disposable and designed to tear like tissue paper under a load of more than five or ten pounds. Even if I didn't have my own nanny bot following me every waking moment-and crouching on its base in my room as I sleep, recharging but still watchful, like a napping housecat-I am always in full view of at least one security camera, and human attendants are only thirty to sixty seconds away at all times.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Meds,\" the robot announced, and I dutifully shuffled to the sink, got a glass of water, and swallowed the handful of pills the robot spat out onto a little tray for me. It made me think of baby birds accepting regurgitated meals from their mother. I stifled a laugh; the robots did not understand humor and viewed it with suspicion. I would say this makes them less than sentient, but the human orderlies here don't understand humor, either.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I didn't have to stay in my tediously safe room very long, because the robot stirred, said, \"Time to see Dr. Mills,\" and trundled out the door on its little treads, leaving me to follow in its wake.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When the weather's good, the doctor likes to meet me on the facility grounds, where two park benches sit facing one another. I brought my notebook with me so I wouldn't have to look at the way his jowly, florid cheeks push his blue eyes into narrow slits behind small wire-rimmed spectacles, or the perspiration darkening his pale hair. Instead I looked at my notebook, or the ground, or the green golf shirt stretched tight over his pot belly. After inquiring about my health, he got right down to business.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mina, can you tell me the name of your college roommate?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I drew a rough cartoon, a blank circle for a head with two curved lines to indicate a neck and shoulders. \"Which one? I had three.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The first one.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I shaded in the featureless head and tried to dredge up a name. \"She always made me think of Anne of Green Gables. Earnest like that. And-there's a smell of cinnamon. Maybe she was a redhead?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He leaned forward expectantly. A single blond chest hair peeked out of his open collar. \"Was she in the student protest group?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I laughed. \"I have no idea. I think she liked white wine spritzers.\" My memories are solid from childhood through high school, Swiss cheese from there through my junior year, and a blank wall after that.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Fine. When was the attack supposed to happen?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't know,\" I said. I set the notebook aside and brushed a speck of dirt off my loose white cotton smock. Funny that they dressed the patients more like doctors than the doctors in this place. \"I don't even know if there was supposed to be an attack.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What day of the week?\" he pressed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't know.\" I picked up my stubby felt-tip again and rapped it, hard, on the pad.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What about the time? Sunrise? Dusk? Midnight?\" The urgency in his voice made me look up. A fine mist of perspiration gleamed on his upper lip.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I squeezed the felt-tip tightly in my hand. \"I. Don't. Know.\" It was an effort to keep my voice level and calm. If I wasn't calm, though, my Cheerful Friend might roll in and tranquilize me, just to be on the safe side.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But you can see a picture in your mind,\" he said. \"Just a flicker, maybe, or an impression. Like your roommate and the smell of cinnamon.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" I said. \"There's nothing.\" It was nearly true. There might have been something, but I wasn't sure what it was, and I wasn't about to tell him about it. \"I am physically incapable of remembering,\" I said, stressing each syllable. \"You know that. Why bother with all this?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He shrugged. The arrogant smirk under his stubby nose made him look more like a pig than ever. \"We're getting further. The drugs are helping. You will remember.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's been forty years--look at me!\" I hold out my arms as evidence, the flesh on them wasted, the skin flabby. For some reason, this makes the doctor chuckle. \"What does it matter? Why don't you leave me alone?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"People want the truth. Don't you think they deserve it? You could be vindicated--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Or condemned--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Which already happened a long time ago.\" He leaned back against the park bench and draped an arm casually over the back of it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"All the more reason to keep my mouth shut,\" I said. \"And my mind.\" I remembered the arrest and my holding cell, but not a trial, or prison, or being transferred to this place, although they showed me documents, photographs, recordings.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He waved away the idea like an irritating insect. \"They're all dead, Mina. All those people you're still trying to protect forty years later. Dead, or in places like this with holes cut out of their memories, waiting to die. You can't save them or help them. You don't need to protect them anymore.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I began drawing in a brick wall behind the blank-faced person on my notepad. \"And you don't need my confession any more. So why bother?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You know there are the medical ramifications to consider.\" He leaned forward again and his face took on a kindly, paternal look, though he was at least fifteen years younger than I. \"Others want to remember, and can't. You can help many more who struggle with all kinds of psychological trauma. And a breakthrough could improve your care here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I snorted. \"I am an old woman. I have grown old in your <i>care</i>, if you want to call it that. Let somebody else help the amnesiacs and trauma victims. Let the dead bury their own dead.\" As I spoke, I saw something slip out of his pocket and drop soundlessly onto the grass. A pen. A real one, a ballpoint with a metal barrel, not the felt-tips they issue patients here.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You aren't dead yet, Mina.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, I suppose not.\" Who knew for sure? This place has all the marks of a highly personal purgatory, a place to expiate one's sins, and my memory loss leaves me unmoored in time, vulnerable. I sometimes look down and see my body as a corpse, or devoured by extreme age, my arms and legs sticks. Sometimes in dreams I am thirty, the age I was when they took me, with nothing more than a scattering of gray in my hair as harbingers.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I can tell they are dreams because the doctor is there and utterly unchanged by any passage of time. He is always in his fifties, the age he is now, slightly gone to seed, the perfect age of paternal authority. Only I am different, young again, the muscle restored to my hands and arms. I can never see my own face-there are no mirrors anywhere here, awake or dreaming-but my breathing is easy and painless, and the dozen small aches and twinges of age are gone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sometimes I dream I am back in the cell where they questioned me after I was first captured. I remember the walls painted white, the fluorescent lights buzzing twenty-four hours a day. The lights were hung ten feet up with protective grilles bolted on so I couldn't smash them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I watched the pen fall from the doctor's pocket onto the grass, and remembered a dream I'd had the night before. I was strapped down in the white room. They forced open my jaws to accept a rigid plastic mouthpiece that scraped my gums as the doctor shoved it in.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was a paste smeared in it, bitter herbs mixed with the coppery taste of my own blood. I wanted to gag, but was flat on my back, and the mouthpiece had straps which an orderly secured around my head, so I breathed and tried to stay calm instead. I could twist my head a bare inch to the left, and saw foamy green flecks of drool hit the pillow.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then... time, and time, and time out of mind.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Give me back my withered flesh, my sparse white hair. I don't want this burden of memory. Give me 2073, not 2033.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Inside this dream I can remember. Waiting, walking, the night streets shining with rain. My palms are hot. Am I waiting for my lover to call? For the signal to post my report? For the right time to press a detonator switch? The street is empty because it's ten minutes before curfew. I have something someone wants. There's to be an exchange.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My gait is a young woman's, my stride confident. My bones are strong; I won't lose my balance, and even if I fell I wouldn't shatter a hip. If the shops weren't all closed I'd buy a coffee and a newspaper, maybe cigarettes to keep me company. No, I never was much of a smoker, but a little light and heat would be welcome here on the midnight pavement.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Someone is coming. If I had a cigarette, I would stub it out now. I will not look at my contact's face, or even notice whether it is a man or woman; safer that way for both of us.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Agitation surrounds me suddenly, buzzing in the air like angry insects. A gloved hand reaches out to take what I have come to offer.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then I fall through time again, back to the park, trying not to stare at a simple ballpoint pen lying among the grass blades.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The doctor fidgeted on his park bench. \"You're doing great, Mina. I think you're making real progress.\" I could still taste the bitter herbs in my mouth.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Salvia,\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" His eyeglasses flashed in the sunlight.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I have a taste in my mouth. Right now. It's salvia.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Interesting.\" He made a note in my chart--redundant, since the robot captured and transcribed every word we uttered. \"Did you take salvia often when you were younger?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, no. I--\" but I had to stop there, because I didn't know how I knew the taste of salvia.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He patted my arm, smiling at me and my skinny, sexless body.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You'll remember sometime.\" He smiled his most unctuous smile, and left.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>You know, I don't believe I will.</i> I managed to refrain from saying it aloud; in the robot's constant presence, I might as well whisper in the doctor's ear. I had to be very careful. There were dandelions, weeds growing right up by the bench where the doctor had been sitting, brave things in this sanitized, regulated place. I picked a few for my room, scooping up the pen at the same time, I hoped unobserved. Just an ordinary ballpoint, but it was heavy in my hand. Dangerous. It could make so much possible.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sometimes I dream I'm young again and so is everyone else. Craig is shuffling around in his bathrobe and slippers, still hunched over and pushing his walker, but his forearms are the size of my calves and he's two inches taller and only forty years old, not eighty. I want to shout, \"You're young!\" but I know I mustn't, the robots are still here, and they never change, never stop listening, watching.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lately I haven't been able to tell waking from dreaming. The states overlap and intersperse, a symptom of my dementia, they say. My young hand grasps the edge of the bench while I talk to the doctor, but I feel the weight of years bending my back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can return, in your mind,\" the doctor has told me. \"You can be that young woman again and remember. Remember your friends, your lovers, your plans and dreams. You can have it all back.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It's the drugs that will provide this miracle. And I can see that they will work, eventually. I have already caught glimpses of faces, the angle of a jaw, remembered a single word. It is starting to come back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That's why now, tonight, I have to commit this most antisocial of acts. I finger the doctor's shiny ballpoint.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I have gotten an idea as I have flitted back and forth between 2033 and 2073, dreaming and waking, as my flesh has sloughed and reformed like soil enriched and eroded by the flooding of the Nile. I have gotten the notion that it may be 2073, or it may actually be 2033. Maybe my friends are still alive and endangered by my returning memories. What better way to bypass the blocks in my memory than to bore holes through them with drugs and convince me that it's all irrelevant now anyway, nothing to save, nothing to protect, just the rambling recollections of an old woman?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Since there is no way for me to know for sure whether it's 2073 or 2033, I'm afraid I won't be able to provide the doctor with the footnotes to history he so desires--especially since I'm not entirely sure whether my history has actually played out yet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Although my memory is confused, I know, and do not know how I know, the precise angle and amount of force needed for a single strike to my own inner thigh: the femoral artery. Then a second strike to the throat: the trachea. I have this one chance, the pen, this one weapon left to me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My arm muscle twitches. I will know what to do.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">To my unrecollected revolutionaries, loves, and friends: <i>Adieu.

I crumple the paper and toss it onto the pile on the floor.  I've been trying to write a poem based on late twentieth-century tabloid headlines, but I can't get the tone.  And I have a dance piece due in a week I need to get to work on, a tricky bit of classical ballet on the rise and fall of antibiotics.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I close my notebook and reach out to my sister, who sits in front of me in our sloppy, comfortable den.  She murmurs and folds back into my lap without looking up from her reading, and I ruffle my hands through her thick hair.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She is teeming with lice.  My fingers move happily, grooming gently through her hair, a game older than the pyramids.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My history lectures echo in my head; humans have groomed for lice since, well, since before we were humans.  Our nails evolved to do this, to help control the things when they were parasites.  I gently fold another lock of hair across to expose a bare line of scalp, see movement; without thinking my fingers deftly catch a fat one and tug it loose.  I examine it wriggling for a moment, then pop it between my teeth.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Contentment floods through me, and a tiny taste of blood.  Waves of chemical data hit my jaw, my taste buds, my throat.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She's fine.  I stroke her hair, and she shifts a little in my lap.  I know things now; she's calm, she's not in love. She's not sick.  She's not on her period.  There's a little acrid bite to it, a little memory of thin and bitter.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You forgot to eat yesterday,\" I tell her.  \"Again.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She twists her head to give me half a mild glare that tells me to stop fussing, then turns back to her book. I'm glad to know she's all right.  I get up and go to the kitchen for a snack.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My little brother Aiden is under the table again.  My mother shakes her head at me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He won't do his work!  June, talk to him.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I stick my head under the table to face him eye to eye.  He gazes back at me earnestly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Aiden,\" I say.  \"This is very serious.\"  We both break into giggles.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Let me ask you one!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I sigh, theatrically. \"One.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"OK...\"  He writes a second order differential equation on his tablet on the floor.  I roll my eyes at him and start to write a line after his.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You just have to solve the quadratic!\" he says, the end of the sentence disappearing in more giggles.  His laughter is infectious.  I abandon him and return to my mother and the top of the table.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's all he wants to do! And he has a raku pot due tomorrow, he hasn't even asked me to start the kiln.  That stuff is going to--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Rot his brain?\" I finish for her.  She glares at me, eyes narrowing, and I look down and take her hand and fiddle with her fingers.  \"I did a lot of math too, when I was his age,\" I remind her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her hands are long and worn.  Little flea bites scatter up her arm to her shoulder, a reminder of her trip to Florida last month.  When she got back we all sat and groomed her for a day, hoping for a taste of a favorite relative before our native lice killed off all the hitchhiker fleas.  My grandfather is coppery and harsh; my cousin Claire is pregnant and happy and full of hormones.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She sees me looking at the bites.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A heavier touch,\" she says.  \"They have Ebola and malaria to manage, the lice won't do it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I know,\" I tell her.  But I'm glad we have our lice, with their nice light touch engineered in.  One more reason not to live in the south.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I wander to the front room to watch my father and brothers wrestle on the yard in the long grass and thick cover of dead leaves.  The boys are getting stronger, but my father still tosses them like gangly half-mature puppies, and like puppies they run after him down the lane.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I worry that Aiden has not joined them.  My father is a serious man, a strong poet and a wild artist.  By the time they were Aiden's age my brothers were charging him like little bulls, fighting each other and climbing his legs like trees.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Now they are maturing; their verses are dense and complicated and they spend days in the woods drawing and sleeping under the canopy of branches and the night sky.  At this rate they will be men soon, and he will throw them out, and they will wander a time in the world.  I will miss them, my smelly brothers.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Aiden is a little fey. To still be so wrapped up in math at his age...  I worry that he will dive ever deeper into it, that he will never turn his mind to something less frivolous.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I feel his hand on my leg and turn around.  Gravely, he is holding a pinched forefinger and thumb towards me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are you all right?\" I ask him.  \"Are you sick?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's not from me,\" he tells me, and I notice he has a twist of paper in his other hand; he has brought it home from school folded in the paper to give to me.  \"Do you remember Lissa?  In my class?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I remember her.  Do you like her?\" I ask him.  He nods, and holds his pinched fingers out to me.  I take the louse from him, still a little puzzled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I bite.  She is: well fed, healthy, a little obsessive, not yet sexually mature. She has a slight cold.  And also...</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What is that?\" I ask my brother.  He looks at me in triumph.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Algebraic topology.\"  Happiness beams out of him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I laugh at him and pick him up and carry him under my arm to the kitchen for a cookie and his pottery homework.  He squirms loose, but his feet barely hit the floor before he leaps onto me again, his fingers clutching my clothing, climbing my leg like it's a tree.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/k-s-o-neill/nitpick", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText \"><b>***Editor's Note: Disturbing, and a smattering of adult language***</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">The refugees drove west in a creaking convoy. Most of the cars were almost out of fuel. Many were on the verge of breaking down. The shoulders of the highway were littered with stopped and wrecked cars.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Only a few of those whose cars had failed--those with fuel to trade or young children to tug on the heartstrings of some brave bachelor--had seen rescue. The engorged sun and ambient radiation made short work of the rest. Once their cooling systems failed, they either sweated  away their lives within a few hours or accumulated a lethal dose of radiation when they stepped outside to attempt repairs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But that was the price they paid for being foolish and unprepared. Roger Deryn had spent his life on this highway, and he'd never come within a mile of death. Roger was prepared for everything. And that's why Roger was the one who was headed east, fast and cool, to turn a profit off the slowly-failing dome that these poor folks were fleeing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger's car was a silver bullet: a lounge on wheels. There was no driver's seat; the car drove itself better than any human ever could. Instead, the cabin was given over to three autonomous, fully-reclining, swiveling chairs in which Roger, his wife, Sarah, and their daughter, Madison, whiled away this long drive in the quiet bliss of mutual companionship.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger's watch displayed a message from the car's nav system.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Only two hours away,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm so tired of these sales,\" Madison said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How do you know we're going to a sale?\" Roger said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's always a sale.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This was supposed to be a surprise,\" Sarah said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are we going to Tulsa?\" Madison tapped her screen. \"Really? This soon?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This is going to be one of the singular events of your life,\" Roger said. \"I don't think I have ever seen nor even heard of a sale as big as this one. So we're going early, and you know why? Because I think this is where you're finally gonna get your car.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sarah sighed quietly. She wasn't looking forward to driving back by herself. Sarah hadn't driven alone in a long time. But she'd talked this through with her husband last night. Roger and Madison would drive back in the new car. Roger had already confirmed that the car he'd found was still in its driveway. Sarah wondered if the car's owner was lying dead somewhere on this highway.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana was sitting by the window of her house, staring at the steadily rising temperature on the thermostat. Adriana's mansion was one of the richest in East Tulsa: a massive Victorian meant to house four generations, from newborn babies to slow-dying elders. It had once stood in a neighborhood of such houses, but most of them had been torn down to make room for energy-efficient dome-molded dwellings. Even the surviving Victorians had been modernized and subdivided: they had three outside staircases heaped onto their backs, and dirty backyards full of communal furniture. They looked sluttish and exhausted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger Deryn had scoped out Adriana's still-pristine mansion three weeks ago. Now, he pulled into her carport as if he was an old friend.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger pointed out the Lexus in the carport. \"That beautiful beast is gonna be all yours. Don't worry. Houses like these? They're always empty by now. The owner--Joseph Santos--is probably halfway to Oklahoma City. He'll be pleased as punch when he gets my offer.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana ran out into the bare sun--her skin steaming visibly--and beat on the hatch of the car.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Joseph?\" she said. \"Miguel? My god, did you\u2026?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She pressed her face to the side-glass. Her hands were cupped around her eyes. She was trying to peer in, but the glass was opaque.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger was in the back, shouting for his wife and daughter to put on their cooling-suits, while he unpacked the portable generator which would provide the power to cool the house while they ransacked it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Fifteen minutes passed before the side door rolled up, and the steaming woman fell inside.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I think these are the original brass door knobs,\" Roger said. \"Some of my contacts said that the owners'd ripped out all the original fittings during a renovation, but I really do think these are the originals.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana was on the couch with her face under a leaking plastic bag that held a few cubes of ice. She tried to drink some water, but swallowing felt like rubbing pieces of sandpaper against the insides of her throat.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sarah and Madison sat opposite her on the seats in the living room. Sarah poured some water from Adriana's crystal pitcher into one of her water glasses.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're... you're here for the sale,\" Adriana said. \"This is so early.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Roger likes to be early,\" said Sarah. \"He's not afraid of meeting the owners.\" That's why he brought Sarah along. How many expiring homeowners had she conversed with during these sales? No other broker's wife was willing to sit face-to-face with the dead. Sarah was the secret to Roger's success.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's so cold here,\" Adriana said. The temperature was hovering around eighty. Adriana's bones vibrated with the continuous hum of the house's air conditioner. She'd been attuned to it for so many years; the past few weeks, when they'd had to skimp on cooling to conserve power, had felt viscerally wrong.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I just hooked up our generator to your house's grid,\" Roger called out. He'd wandered into one of the guest rooms. \"Crown-molded fittings. A full-length Edwardian mirror. I think this dresser is a Daniels and Brothers 1927 original.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Does your car work?\" Madison said. \"The Lexus?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not now,\" Sarah said. \"She's tired.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"She's dying,\" Madison said. \"We're going to have to go out there and take a look eventually. Why not just ask her?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It has very little gas,\" Adriana said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How many miles are on it?\" said Madison.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sarah glared at her daughter. \"Madison! This is not how we do things.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana's head was aching. \"I need my car,\" she said. \"For Joseph and Miguel. I thought you were them. My husband drives a car like yours.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You have a lovely home,\" Sarah said. \"It looks like the renovation was very well done.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana didn't say anything. A car pulled up outside. \"Joseph,\" she murmured.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison got up and walked towards the carpeted anteroom at the front of the house. She pulled one of the blackout curtains aside. A car had parked in front of the house, and a man in a plastic cooling suit was coming up the walk, carrying a tan leather briefcase.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He was about to press the calling button when Madison made the door transparent. \"We're already here,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But this is my home,\" said the man.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"People don't ring the caller at their own home,\" Madison said. \"This is our find. Move to the next on your list.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She opaqued the door and watched through the window until the man left.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Who was that?\" said Roger, coming down the stairs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Another vulture,\" she said. \"Are we done here? It's too bad we're not gonna get that car; I think that woman is still planning to evacuate in it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I keep telling you to come out on more shopping trips. You're always too willing to take no for an answer.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I just sent that other guy packing, didn't I?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Did he give you any trouble?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Tried to tell me this was his house.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Was he armed?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't think so. He was alone, too.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Okay, good job. And don't worry. We'll get you your car. This place is a once-in-a-lifetime find. Definitely worth the time I spent scoping it out. And we're gonna get every last thing that we can.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sarah gave Adriana another glass of water.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your husband and son were part of the repair team?\" Sarah said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Joseph is acting chief engineer for the dome,\" Adriana said. \"He's run the whole effort ever since Robertson--he was Joseph's superior--killed himself. It's been such a long year.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And your son?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He's only a boy, but he came home to help. He is a student at Caltech.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You must be very proud of him.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I think he might come back to me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"God willing.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't think that Joseph will return. He'd never leave the break site.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They haven't yet told you whether the break is unfixable?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not officially. But Joseph told me to leave three days ago. I told my neighbors. Everyone is leaving.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Everyone except you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My daughter is gone. She is a lawyer for the city. She is going to our sister-city. Galveston. Her firm promised her a spot there, if she could make it, and to pay the dome buy-in. Me, though? I haven't held a real job since I was my daughter's age. Why bother to buy me in?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But maybe your husband has gone on without you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My husband won't ever leave the repair site. Not until it is hopeless. And then it will be too late. Joseph is never coming home.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger walked in from the anteroom. This was a rich find--one of the richest--but the knock at the door had shaken him. More cars were entering the city now. The sale was still in its early stages, but it had definitely begun.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Has my wife discussed our offer?\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, I won't sell,\" Adriana said. She hadn't known until that moment that she was going to refuse these people.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We can offer some very favorable terms. Let's say... ten thousand up-front, ten percent of net, and... free transport to Oklahoma City.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't need money.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh. You were well-diversified?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Her husband was--is--chief engineer for the city,\" Sarah said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Right,\" Roger said. \"A city employee? Highly salaried, I'm sure, but where did he invest? You can't be too well-diversified; I imagine his contract had a conflict-of-interest clause that limited foreign holdings. This city has defaulted on its bonds. Local stocks have dipped precipitously since the crack was detected. Are you sure you're taken care of?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I need you to leave now,\" Adriana said. \"I need to wait for my husband. I need to wait for my son.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, but we couldn't leave,\" Sarah said. \"Not after finding you in such a poor state.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thank you for your help. The house will pass to my daughter. She is driving to Galveston right now. After I am dead, she will decide what to do.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger nodded to Sarah and she nodded back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana sipped from the glass of water. It was her glass. Her couch. Her home.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Please... thank you so much,\" Adriana said. Her skin was still hot. When she closed her eyes, she saw spots.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, I guess that's that,\" Roger said. \"It'll just take a moment to disconnect my generator from your grid.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison had lingered in the anteroom, watching the cars cruise past. Not many, maybe one every other minute. Most brokers didn't do as much prep-work as her dad. They didn't know where they were going. They just rolled slowly down the street, looking for empty carports and abandoned-looking houses. This was the nicest part of town, so this is where they'd come first. By now, half the houses on this block must have a broker inside.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison hoped that this old lady sold up soon. She'd already spent too many afternoons in a cold-suit, standing around with her family, watching some homeowner die of heat stroke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sarah was still in the living room, looking at the latest weather data, trying to figure out how quickly the house's batteries would run down under the current temperature conditions.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger was downstairs, checking on the cooling system. With his generator disconnected, the temperature was already rising. He tried to calculate which pieces would be permanently damaged by the heat-warping. That dresser would easily lose fifty percent of its value. That was ten thousand down the drain, dammit. Wasn't there anything he could offer her?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When he came back upstairs, Roger said, \"It's a shame. Your daughter probably won't be able to recover much, if anything, from this place after the heat gets to it. Not to mention that she won't be on-site to verify estimates. Some of these sharpers will really gouge her.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Money is worth little to us, now,\" Adriana said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You've about given up, then? Don't you think you owe it to your family to--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Is this your profession? What a strange thing to train your children in.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana drifted upstairs to her bedroom. She locked the door behind her. Roger waited on the other side.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We can get you out of here,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I could get myself out, if there was anywhere I wanted to go. Please leave. I am filing a complaint with your licensing board.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Downstairs, Madison sat by the front door.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her father came down. \"Don't you worry. You're getting that car, honey.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison glanced at her father. His forehead was sweating and he was scratching incessantly at a tuft of hair on his temple. \"Right,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her father went to the living room.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Another cool-suited man was walking towards the house. Madison stood behind the door. This one didn't have a car with him. Maybe he was a real bootstrapper who'd carpooled his way here and was relying on finding something nice enough to warrant calling a cab to lug it back to Oklahoma City.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The man was sweating feverishly inside his cool-suit. It was streaked with grime and mud. He was only wearing a white undershirt beneath the suit. He punched in a code on the call-pad, and opened the outer door.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm sorry,\" Madison said. \"We're already here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Who are you?\" he said. \"This is my house.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't give me that sca-- well, you did have the code.\" She yelled, \"Dad? I think the son is here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her dad was at the inner door within a moment. He looked at the stranger and said, \"Well, dammit, what are you doing? Let him in!\" Roger opened the inner door, letting in a furnace blast of hot air, and pulled the cool-suited figure inside.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger stared at the young man sitting at the kitchen table. The kid was badly sunburned all across his face and arms. Whether the kid was radioactive or not, Roger didn't know.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So you walked here,\" Roger said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I came from the site. Our phones stopped working. All the cars that I hailed were going away from here and not towards. What the hell is happening? Why are you here?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, this is a difficult situation. Your father, you see, had made a deal with us a few days back, to settle up the house and its contents in return for looking after his wife and you and making sure you got away from here safely. But she's locked herself upstairs. She doesn't want to leave.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My dad said we all need to evacuate. He's doing everything he can, but total collapse is imminent.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, then why don't you go on upstairs, talk to your mother, and get her ready to leave.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What are you--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come on, get going now.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy got up. His youthful hands were shaking. His whole body was tinged with red. Roger wondered again whether the boy was on his last legs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Even Miguel didn't know. He no longer had access to a lab to develop the radiation exposure strips he carried.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison was upstairs, outside Adriana's door. Her mother had set her down out there, and told her not to let the old woman leave.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison didn't think she was going to get that car. She wished she'd found some way to wriggle out of this whole expedition. This was so tedious. She usually managed to get something out of these trips, but the prize was rarely worth suffering through all these scenes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The door opened, and Adriana tried to exit. Madison slowly maneuvered her back into the room. The old woman's face seemed more wrinkled than it'd been an hour ago, and wisps of grey hair were stuck, by sweat, to her forehead and cheeks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do you need?\" Madison said. She pushed forward into the old woman's room. \"Whatever it is, I can get it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I see cars in the street. Has my husband come? You have to leave now. This is my home. This is my city. None of it is yours yet.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Steps came up the stairs. Miguel stood in the door behind them. Adriana cried out, ran forward, and embraced him. She pulled him down and kissed him on the cheeks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're here,\" she said. \"You're here...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Miguel held his mother. \"Are you ready to leave?\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana sighed. \"I didn't think you were coming.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Dad is still working.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I expected that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But he sent me home. He sent almost everyone home; he only kept Lorenco, Swann, and Team Four.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"God bless them.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Pack what you need. I'll check on the car.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But I... we don't have enough gasoline. I gave it all to your sister.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't worry about that,\" he said. \"You just get yourself ready.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Miguel's eyes passed, unseeing, over Madison. He turned to go, stumbled a bit, and Madison stepped forward to catch him, but his arm shot out and he steadied himself against the doorjamb.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After he'd left, Adriana sat down on the bed. She closed her eyes and counted to sixty. When she opened them, Madison was standing in front of her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't you have a bag?\" Madison said. \"I can help you start to...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana was motionless. Madison rooted through the woman's closets. She found a suitcase and set it on the bed, next to Adriana. During her first few trips back from the closet, she showed the items to the old woman, and tried to get her to nod or something if they were things she wanted to keep. But she got no response. Finally she just started picking things that'd suit for a whole range of weathers. She brought out a heavy winter jacket. Maybe, after all this, the woman would want to go north.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can see that you don't have hardly more than a drop of gas,\" Roger said. The cold-suited broker was standing over Miguel as the boy checked out the Lexus. \"But I'm logged onto the Tulsa city-net. There are still plenty of offers for space in the refugee convoys. Fewer spaces than there were six hours ago, sure, but this city really respects your father. They'll make room for you and your mother.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No,\" Miguel said. \"We'll drive ourselves.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I just don't see how you're going to. Every drop of gas within a hundred miles of here is selling for its weight in gold. And you don't have any money anymore. The banks here are gone. Your local stocks are worthless. Your mom said you aren't diversified. Not your father's fault, of course, but still... it's going to be hard for you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You'll give us the gas we need.\" Miguel closed the hood of the car. \"In return for what you came for....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh well, I don't think...\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My father never dealt with you. He thought we'd beat this break, like we did the last one, and the one before. He never made escape plans. That wasn't his way. But he did like his paintings, and his antiques. Give us the barrel of gas you're holding. We'll carry away the jewelry and anything else we can. You'll get the rest. Oh, and we'll need the cost of two more Galveston dome buy-ins.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My, well... two buy-ins? We'll have to discuss this....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When the boy was gone, Roger ran a hand over the Lexus. It was in perfect shape. There was something caught in the hood, though. The man pried out the little strip of plastic and metal: one of the boy's radiation exposure strips. It must've gotten snagged and been pulled off his cold-suit.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison was folding the old woman's clothes when her son came in.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come on, Mama,\" Miguel said. \"We're headed for Galveston inside an hour. We have the fuel.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You have what?\" Madison said</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your father sold me the gas I needed. Now stop bothering my mother.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No he didn't. That gas is for my car.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Miguel looked at her oddly and then left.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison was seething. This was such horseshit. She'd come all this way for nothing. She looked at Adriana.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're pretty lucky to be leaving,\" Madison said. \"It hardly ever turns out this well, you know? My dad says I've probably seen more sales than anyone else my age. I've been in a lot of houses just like this. Usually, if they're still here by the time we arrive, the owners don't ever end up leaving.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There's no need to pack,\" Adriana said. \"I'd prefer you didn't.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman was staring at herself in the mirror mounted in the vanity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're going to need clothes,\" Madison said. \"I don't know what the weather's like in Galveston.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I was born in Tulsa,\" Adriana was still staring at herself in the mirror. \"My father's father was rich enough to climb up into the sky and spend the rest of his life--before the cancers got him--building our dome. He pledged his fortune to importing ten buses of engineers and technicians from Southern California and to feeding and housing them while they worked. It exhausted his fortune, and there wasn't much left for my father. But many of those men stayed, and they remembered. Their families remembered. My father served twelve terms on the city council. I've seen every inch of our city. I tagged along with my father on his visits, and ate in workmen's homes. I pulled the switch that ushered the changing of the seasons. I moved the dials of night and day. When it was my time to marry, I was not like my brothers and sisters. I did not consider leaving, or marrying for love. I went out into the world and found a man who could enrich our city. We prospered together. When my father died, I took up his seat on the council and served for eight years, until my brother wanted to run. This city is mine. When I shouted, it responded. How could I live somewhere else? My children are young enough to make new lives, and learn to love new things. But I am not.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah,\" Madison said. \"That's more what you owners are usually like.\" The suitcase wouldn't close. She looked up Galveston on her phone. Annual lows were only down in the sixties. She unpacked the winter coat and looked around in the closet for a fleece or something. She found a musty sweater in the back. She shook it a little and then pushed it into the suitcase. She put a knee on top of the suitcase, and finally managed to latch it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The old woman had opened the drawers of her vanity. She withdrew a diamond necklace and put it on.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison said, \"Come on. You have to go.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She grabbed Adriana's arm below the shoulder. The woman's limb was so thin that it was like grabbing a bone covered in plastic wrap. The woman clutched Madison's hand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Look,\" Madison said. \"I liked your story, and I understand. But your kids will be really sad if you don't go. Your son is back. You've already gotten one miracle. Don't waste it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana patted Madison's hand. \"Please call my son. I will tell him.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I won't let you not go. I don't think that all this dying is very pretty at all. Normally it at least saves us some money. But your son is going off anyway. It won't cost a thing for you to go, too. So that's what's happening.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison pulled the woman to her feet, and started dragging her downstairs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison's parents watched the struggle with coldly quizzical glances. Sarah was about to start scolding her daughter, but Roger intervened. Finally, the girl was showing a little interest in the work. It wouldn't hurt to let things play out. By the time they reached the garage, there wasn't much more fight left in the old woman. Roger and Madison shared a glance as Adriana muttered, \"No, I've decided to stay.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're going,\" Madison said. \"You're not strong enough to stop it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Even inside the cold-suit, Miguel was sweating. There was a long drive ahead of him, and not many places to stop. Most domes wouldn't let him in. They were too afraid he'd try to stay. Still, his sister had phoned. Between them they'd just managed to scrape together the money for two more buy-ins. He had a full tank and a few more canisters in the trunk: when that ran out, maybe he'd be far enough away that someone would have some gas for sale.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mama, didn't you pack any luggage?\" Miguel said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah,\" Madison said. \"Wait.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She ran upstairs, taking the steps two at a time.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The toppled-over vanity was spilling its jewelry. The woman had upset it in the initial struggle. Madison crouched down and picked up the diamond necklace that she had \"accidentally\" ripped off Adriana.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison smiled out of the corner of her mouth. She pocketed the necklace, and rummaged through the rest of the vanity with the eye of a broker's daughter, looking for the most valuable pieces. Then she dragged the overheavy suitcase downstairs.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It took twenty-six hours of round-the-clock work to assess and pack all the valuables in the house. The more durable goods were put in a shipping container and stored inside a concrete bunker. Roger would come back for them in a few weeks, when gas was cheaper.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Unexpectedly, Madison threw herself into the work. She meticulously photographed every piece and by the time they bundled themselves into the car for the ride home, she'd already started to build an auction database for the house's contents. Seeing her, Roger started thinking it was time for a long talk with Madison about whether she might someday want to become a partner in the brokerage.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They were almost home when Roger told the car to slow down a little. He made the walls transparent and light flooded the cabin. Roger turned his seat sideways to watch the shoulder of the highway.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What the hell, dad?\" said Madison. \"I'm trying to sleep.\" The car was crowded with boxes of fragile artifacts. Madison was also curled up around the bulges of jewelry in her purse and pockets. The stress of hiding her loot had made her increasingly anxious over the past day. At least twice she'd thought she was discovered, and once she'd been a second from preemptively confessing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just wait,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She sat up. <i>Oh crap. Did he know?</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They drove for almost an hour while Roger stared at the shoulder and didn't say anything. Finally, a silver glint appeared.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You know what I think that is?\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A silver Lexus with Tulsa plates. Madison's eyes widened.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Can't be,\" she said. \"Did you short them on gas?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just wait and see.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, god. You sabotaged the car, didn't you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What!\" Sarah said. \"Your father would never do that!\" <i>Would he?</i> She tried to signal to Roger with a flick of her eyes. What the hell was going on? He hadn't mentioned a word about this to her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Roger's car stopped behind the Lexus.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Put on your cold suits,\" Roger said. \"Make sure you have full cooling reservoirs and unscratched radiation shielding. You might be suited for a while.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Miguel's unsuited body was lying in front of the car. The sun had desiccated him. But he was also covered in angry red boils.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Those must have broken out before he died,\" Sarah said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He didn't want to keep exposing her,\" Roger said. \"That was brave.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What happened?\" Madison said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Radiation poisoning,\" Roger said. \"I found his exposure strip and developed it in the car. He'd absorbed much more than lethal dosage; he was a walking ghost. I thought I'd let him drive the car as far as he could, and then see if we could pick it up afterwards.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He smiled at his wife and daughter.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well,\" he said. \"I told you I'd get it.\" Looking at their blank faces, he wondered if maybe he'd crossed a line. The solution had come to him so suddenly and so perfectly. For the last hour, he'd been mentally calculating and recalculating the kid's expected lifespan.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But... I mean... there's nothing that anyone could have done for him,\" Roger said. \"And I know how much you two hate it when we have to wait for some old woman to die. I thought... I'd... well... save us all some trouble....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison took three steps forward and hugged her dad tightly. She looked past his shoulder and out at the dead man. He was on his belly. He could've been anyone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thanks,\" she said. \"I'm sorry I doubted you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What about that woman?\" Sarah said. \"Did she have radiation poisoning?\" She wasn't too sure that she approved of this deviation from their normal method of operating.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't know,\" Roger's smile was bright and full. \"Let's see.\" He trotted over to the car's windows. The cold-suited passenger was utterly still, but, as Roger approached, she flicked her eyes at him and then away.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Looks like she's still alive,\" Roger said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do we do with her?\" Sarah said. \"Can we just leave her?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Guess we'll have to have a short deathwatch after all,\" Roger said. \"By now, this car has to be almost out of gas and her cooling reservoir must be nearly empty. We'll just wait. Then we'll fill it with a little bit of our spare gas and drive it home.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A deathwatch right here?\" Sarah said. \"Out on the road?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sure,\" Roger said. \"It's no big deal. We're well-shielded.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But Madison had grabbed at the driver's side door. The keys were still in the ignition, so the door had never automatically locked. She stepped into the driver's seat and closed the door.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So, here we are again,\" Madison said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why do you persist in bedeviling me?\" Adriana said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't you want to live? Oklahoma City is a nice place. It's easy to love.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Take the car. Leave me with my son's body.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You could teach me about your city. And I could teach you about ours. There's no reason that your life has to end here.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison's words were coming at Adriana as if from the other end of a long tunnel. Even Tulsa seemed far behind her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your kids are beyond your help, you know that? He always was. He was always going to die. But there are a lot of Tulsan refugees crowding into my city. They're going to need your help. You don't have a city. But you still have a people.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana didn't say anything.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We have dome failures in Oklahoma City, too, sometimes,\" Madison said. \"Not often, but sometimes. They've been patching a crack in the southern sector for the last six months. If I live to be your age, then someday what's happening to you will happen to me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison's suit radio crackled. \"What're you doing?\" her father said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"She wants to come with us. I told her that we could get her a G-5 visa as a domestic servant.\" That was a temporary guest worker permit. It meant residence in the city for as long as you worked for one family, and it didn't permit switching employers.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sarah patched in. \"Even a G-5 buy-in costs money. And I doubt she'd be a good worker.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"C'mon,\" Madison said. \"We're making all this money off her stuff.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We already own this 'stuff,'\" Roger said. \"Your mom's right. It's a waste of money. If she'd wanted to come to our city then she could have made contingency plans. Now she has to pay the price for her shortsightedness. Unless... you wanted to pay it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The packages of jewelry in her pockets suddenly felt heavy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So you knew?\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"In a few years you'll have a sense for hidden valuables, too,\" Roger said. \"Did you pocket enough to cover the buy-in?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I... think so....\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, then, what will you do? If you don't make me pay for the woman, I'll let you keep a quarter of the net on the jewelry.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison curled her lip. What a deplorable win-win for her dad. Either she gave up her find, or he taught her the broker's first lesson: human life was only worth what someone was willing to pay for it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Adriana looked at the girl. If they insisted on saving her, then so be it. She'd live amongst them and she'd learn how to be like them. She'd learn how to take the things she needed. Then she'd rally her people. She'd teach them. And someday this girl would learn what it meant to be driven from her home.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Madison felt Adriana's stare and knew that she wasn't going to let the crazy, old woman die. \"You win,\" Madison said.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText \">Razabad is a city of white stone and straight lines.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">This wasn't always true: for a time, migrants tried to put up wavy shanties in empty lots and build huts of corrugated tin that leaned against the stone pylons of underpasses. They tried to live inside cement cylinders and within the few feet of space between the side of the tunnel and the side of the train. But the spider picked their tiny nests apart and tucked everything back into its proper place. The spider is the only thing in Razabad that is allowed to be curvy and jagged.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Although Razabad was planned by a white man, he was chosen because he fit the spirit of modern India: careful, precise, and forward-looking. The planner had to be coaxed across the sea by a saffron-robed freedom fighter who was well-practiced in bringing tears to the eyes of a certain kind of Anglo.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Long before the city became a reality--long before there was even a nation of India that was capable of desiring a monument to its newfound modernity--the planner had spent hours in a tiny office in Geneva where he rotated and maneuvered the pieces of his dream city, bringing them together and pulling them apart, until he despaired of ever producing something that wasn't just a jumble of conflict and ugliness. Until, on one marvelous day, the pieces snapped together and that vision of order rose above him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He wanted to create a city that was so perfectly efficient that its residents barely noticed it operating around them. A city that put a minimum of barriers between its residents and the things that they wanted to do.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And that is the plan that the freedom fighter allowed him to enact.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">With one tiny addition.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Since the planner refused to design the spider, it has no order or unity. It is a dull grey heap of wire and jagged servomotors. The planner's only concession to its existence was to create a bunker--hidden by a line of hills--in which to store it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The migrants rarely try to assert themselves upon Razabad anymore. Now they live orderly lives: rectangles drive them from the light-filled and spacious circles where they live to the vast obelisks where they work to the tree-lined squares where they are allowed to play. It is only very rarely that a rumbling builds up inside them and they spill out of their appointed rectangle and stop up the orderly flow of traffic by overturning vehicles and dynamiting buildings and laying waste to gardens</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">This is not a problem.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The spider simply skitters out of its distant hangar and sits among the fire and disorder for a few moments. And then it flies into action.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Afterwards, the streets and buildings are in different places, but the city retains its essential unity of form and vision. It takes several weeks for new maps and directories to be printed. During this time, residents of Razabad sometimes wander the reconfigured streets for days before they can find their homes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Several decades after its construction, the planner returns to Razabad to accept India's second highest honor: the <i>Padma Vibhushan</i>.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For him, it's a return home. As he's grown older and sicker, more of his mental life has been spent wandering the ur-Razabad that has never left the back of his mind. But the real Razabad is not the same. A vast slum begins on the other side of the ring road--just beyond the spider's range. From the air, Razabad is a white spot amongst the brown. And he can feel his vision humming through the landscape, but... it's somehow been diminished. The roads are narrower. The buildings are smaller. And he thinks, <i>Well, I suppose it never really existed in the way I imagined it did.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So he puts on a smile for the freedom fighter--a man who's only increased in power and respect and responsibility--and they accompany each other to the reception and the ball and the expedition to the newly built power plant. And both of them try to ignore the dark stare they receive from the people who've been pushed behind the barricades so their motorcade can pass.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Only once does the planner venture, \"They must be in a great hurry to get where they need to be?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The freedom fighter smiles and says, \"It's been too long since you've lived here, my friend. Or you'd remember that Indians are never in a hurry.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But when the planner arrives at the staging area for the parade, he's startled. He remembers this hill: it had once been terraced with cool white homes that stared out over the city through eyes of tinted black glass. Now the hill's decorated with the delicately intertwining ribbon patterns that are impressed into the brown dirt by thousands of wheel treads. Hundreds of thousands of people fill the streets of the city below. The crowds--pushed into thin lines by the barricades--vibrate faster and faster.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He says to the freedom fighter, \"What happened, what have you done to my city?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The freedom fighter's response is, \"It was not easy, but we've managed to maintain the purity of your vision, my friend.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Just then, one barricade falls and the crowd gushes into the street. The crowd envelops the sirens, and then a fiery eye weeps black smoke into the air. More barricades fall, more cars are overturned, more fires begin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">On the dais, the freedom fighter raises one hand. A shadow flits over them and only then do they see that the spider's long leg has daggered into the earth beside them. Another moment and it's gone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Its belly hangs over the city and then it is still.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Buildings are aflame now. At the outskirts of the business district, a high-rise rumbles and falls.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What? Are they using explosives?\" the planner says.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do not worry, my friend. It will be taken care of.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The spider's arms shoot outwards in all directions. Buildings are pulled down and entire streets full of rioters are dammed up. Roads are uprooted and parks are delicately rearranged. Material is flying through the air. Mounds of dirt and debris are pushed out of sight, behind the hills, and buildings are nudged sideways. The planner can feel the city shrinking.  In throwing away the destroyed buildings and cannibalizing others for material, the spider is preserving the center of the city at the expense of its edges.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And, for a moment, Razabad shimmers, perfect and new, as if newly extruded from the planner's mind.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But then there's another explosion, and the crowd pours through the corner where it had been penned away. As the spider's arms shoot out over them, the crowds fill the streets with fire.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Turn it off,\" the planner cries. \"If they don't want it, then let them tear it down. Let them tear it all down.\" Tears fill his eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The freedom fighter slowly shakes his head. And then he sinks down into his chair and folds his hands and watches the spider weave it vision.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Can't you see it?\" the freedom fighter murmurs. \"In this whole wonderfully efficient gem of a city, the spider is the only thing that is beautiful.\"</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/rahul-kanakia/the-spider", "title": null},

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Most of Noma's study friends were growing their own boys with the new Vampire, Werewolf, or Wizard Seed kits.  Her best friend Celestine invited Noma to the grow room in her family compartment to take a look at a half-grown vamp.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I specified the golden hair and dark eyebrows,\" Celeste said, \"but he opened his eyes for the first time yesterday, and they're this weird greenish color.  I ordered sky blue.  Skies were blue, right?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They look that way in the history holos,\" Noma said.  Noma glanced sideways into Celestine's eyes, which were the blue they had always called sky.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Celeste turned toward Noma, and reflected grow-light flared in her eyes.  \"What?\" she asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma shook her head and rubbed sweat from her forehead.  The wet air was thick with the smell of grow matrix, acrid and sour.  The grow room sweltered under too-bright lights; its dark red walls were beaded with water.  It was small, a standard-sized room for growing things that didn't need a lot of space.  Noma and Celestine barely fit into it with the boy; the tending station was designed for one person.  \"Can't you turn on the blower?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not while he's growing.  He needs this atmosphere,\" Celeste said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma squatted and stared at the naked boy rooted in the growth matrix. He was still in his chrysalis, a membrane containing him, binding his arms to his sides, and cloaking him in a glistening layer of cloud.  His face had fae eyebrows, straight lines that started at the bridge of the nose and aimed above the ears, like an interrupted V.  The features were perfect, just like the vamps in the trancies.  Noma leaned closer, staring into that perfect face with its slender nose and full red lips.  The rows of dark eyelashes fluttered.  The eyes opened.  They were larger than human eyes, almost anime eye-size, and they were a strange pea-paste green.  She leaned away from him, bumping Celeste.  \"Eww.  Did you buzz the dispensary?\" Noma asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They said they'd send someone to collect and replace him if I wanted, but I'm kind of curious now.  Once he hatches, the warranty expires, though, and I'm stuck with him.  I think I have a couple more days to decide.  What do you think, Nome?  Want one like this?  Or are you going to be a traitor and go to the wolf or wizard side?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You know,\" said Noma, \"I don't think I want anything that's going to bite me.  Did you see Betula's neck in soshe class yesterday?  Owie.\"  She wiped more sweat off her forehead.  Her sleeve wicked the liquid away, but that didn't relieve the heat.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You don't want to design your own, do you?  Crayola did that, and look what she ended up with--that green hairless water thingie that slobbered constantly and couldn't converse.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'll use the Help tools,\" Noma said.  The vampire was staring at her.  His lips parted, and a pointed tongue flicked across the upper one, slicking the inner side of the chrysalis membrane.  \"Ewwie.  I'd buzz the dispensary, Cel.  Eww.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma stopped in the station's communal room and plugged into the general dispensary.  \"Boy time,\" her account reminded her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Shut. Up,\" she said.  But really, that was why she had plugged in.  All the girls her age were experimenting with boymaking.  If she kept ignoring the option, it would trigger attention from the regulators.  She'd had that experience already when she was five and wouldn't play with the minihumans.  She was supposed to design family groupings for them and make them procreate, but she couldn't get herself to tackle the project.  All the other girls finished playing with their minihumans in half a year, but Noma had to do community service for nine months, cleaning out the hydroponics lines, which, as one of her mothers noted, wasn't exactly equivalent service or training.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma hadn't opted for a pet at eight, either, not until the regulators sent her scary messages.  Then she got a snake, because it was very low maintenance.  Not that any of the made-pets took much work.  Still, she was glad she had picked something that didn't do or need much, something she didn't even like.  Most of her friends cried when their pets had to be recycled.  Noma had never bonded with the snake.  Instead she had developed programs that would take care of it without her help.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma's three mothers had muttered about the pet project, which was supposed to train girls to take care of smaller beings in preparation for parenthood.  \"Teach them they can lose what they love,\" Mora said to the other two.  \"Like that's what girls need to learn at eight or nine.  Why don't one of you get on the education committee so we can shift some of these policies?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm not doing it,\" said Anti.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not interested,\" said Ilera.  \"You're the one griping about it.  You do it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But of course Mora never did.  Her strength lay in complaining.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma tapped the \"order boy\" glowspot on the dispensary screen.  It showed her the most popular options, including the vampires, wizards, and werewolves, right at the top.  She could choose skin color, hair color, eye color, and body type, but there wasn't much choice in personalities.  She pressed some options and looked at the sample model, shifted colors, rotated the image to see it from behind.  She didn't like the vampire boys.  The werewolf boys were even worse.  The wizard boys didn't have distinguishing marks, which made her wonder.  Of course, magic didn't work, so what made these boys different?  She checked the specs:  Higher in intuitive skills, more able with energy flow tools.  Huh?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She tapped the \"Vintage\" button.  Ten years earlier, station girls had ordered shapeshifter boys who could change into animals.  Ten years before that, it had been designer skin colors.  Before that, boys with varying numbers of arms and legs, even a two-headed option, which, according to the stats, had not been very popular.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">All these types were still available, or she could invent her own, but she'd have to take care of what she created for a period of six months, no matter what he turned out like.  She remembered Crayola's failure and shuddered.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maybe if she were careful--</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her mother Anti joined Noma in their compartment's grow room.  They both stared at the boy rising from the growth matrix.  \"Oh, Noma,\" Anti said, patting Noma's back, \"you always find a way to get in trouble, don't you?  I wonder whose genes are responsible for that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do you mean?\" Noma said, but of course, she knew.  The boy she had designed looked too much like Celestine.  It hadn't been so obvious in the sample.  She hadn't even realized until yesterday, when he opened his eyes behind the membrane and Noma realized they were the exact color of Celestine's, blue as old Earth skies.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anti's finger hovered over the \"Abort\" button.  \"You can always marry her later, if you still like who she is when she grows up, but if you make it this clear now--you kids are so young.\"  She sighed.  \"What do you want me to do?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How can I kill him when he looks like that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If you let him come to term, you'll have to kill him after you get to know him, and that will be worse,\" said Anti.  \"You'd be better off doing what you did with the pet assignment.  Make something you won't care about.  When I had to kill my boy--\" Anti hung her head, her shoulders drooping.  \"Ilera laughed when they recycled hers, but I don't know.  I think this might be--\" She glanced around and noticed the ever-present monitor eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was a part of the station so private no one Noma knew had ever seen it, the monitor center, where the regulators gathered all the information from every life onboard and evaluated which way to push for a maximum-health community.  Anti sighed, and said, \"I think this 'make a boy, then recycle a boy' might be very bad policy.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What did Mora do?\" Noma asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We didn't know her then.  She was in a different school.  I don't know how she handled it.  She didn't keep a picture of her boy in her memory book, so I don't even know what she chose.  But I think--\" She stared down at the abort button.  \"You should be the one to press it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma knelt and looked at her growing boy.  He stared back, with eyes the color of Celestine's.  His face had no expression; he didn't know enough to feel.  Something swept through her, familiar and frustrating, a longing for something she couldn't imagine.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The station portals showed vast black sky with glowing stars, the biggest one their sun, but so far away!  Sometimes she could see the planets of the system, crescents to the side of the sun, shadows as they moved across its face, small, small, unless she refocused the view and brought them closer.  No matter how hard she looked, they were too far away to touch.  All any of the people had was the station and whatever recorded memories the regulators would let them experience, and sometimes that wasn't enough.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She touched the membrane enclosing her boy, though all the grow instructions said you should never do that.  Its surface was slick, hot, and a little sticky.  A black spot grew beneath her fingertip.  She jerked her hand back, dismayed, and watched the spot spread.  The boy in his sheath grimaced.  His mouth opened, but no sound came out.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma jumped up and pressed the abort button.  The growth matrix parted and the boy dropped back into the vat he had grown from.  It didn't hurt.  All the instruction manuals said it didn't hurt creatures when they were reabsorbed.  All of them said that.  But his grimacing face was burned into her memory.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She turned to her mother, who hugged her tight, letting Noma bury her sobs against Anti's breast.  \"Choose one you won't love,\" Anti whispered in her ear when Noma's sobs had slackened.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Noma slept first, then went back to the dispensary.  She picked a vampire boy, because Celeste had a vampire boy.  She closed her eyes to pick the colors and attributes, letting her finger wander over the screen without watching.  The dispensary played a chime when she had finished, and she looked at what she had ordered.  Dark skin, brown hair, amber eyes, compact body type.  Not like anyone she knew.  She pressed \"select.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She knew she would end up loving him.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/biotech/nina-kiriki-hoffman/boy-seeds", "title": null},

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Dry air settled quietly over an open expanse of sand, rustling furls and eddies into small, invisible tide pools.  Some swept against the base of the Elevator, perhaps a bit hopelessly.  The Elevator did not mind, for it had stood, eclipsing an ever-moving band of desert, for centuries, and would continue to do so for centuries more.  Its paint, once so proudly kept, was weathered.  Dull.  Rust had found a permanent home in the neglected, resilient metal.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The age of the Elevator did not ward curiosity.  Dozens of lucky and wealthy were brought to its shadow every year, eager, anxious.  Some thought they knew what to expect, others arrived readily content.  And what they faced no one, save few who had ridden the Elevator, could tell.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They never told, of course.  Riding the Elevator was a privilege not shared.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A lottery allocated the Elevator's seats.  Those with the means to bully or buy additional tickets from uninterested friends were more often represented.  Still, this did not stop the occasional hopeful from discovering a bland, generic envelope in their mailbox.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It was in such an envelope that a young boy, Veri, learned of his selection.  He had almost thrown the letter out, for it so resembled the unwanted bulk of advertisements and overdue credit warnings.  As he'd turned from the neighborhood's communal pile of waste, his eye caught the lackluster Elevator insignia stamped in an upper corner, faded as if the rubber was in need of fresh ink.  The contents were impersonal and vague.  A location, a time, an identification number.  No congratulation, no vow of secrecy.  Just facts.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri waited days, weeks, months, for his assigned time.  He told no one, and no one assumed.  He was, after all, a poor boy from a poorer family, destined to mediocrity.  He was neither great nor valuable, and he certainly did not believe himself worthy of riding the Elevator.  In fits of anxiety, he would convince himself that, upon arriving in the desert, he would be turned away.  His ripped clothes and dirty face were loud enough to assume that he was, as was fact, only a few steps above the ever-more-common street urchin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The day arrived like days do, cold and quiet.  He hadn't slept the night before.  Fear, anxiety, any number of familiar, uncomfortable emotions had kept him alert.  His brothers, with whom he shared a bedroom, had been annoyed by his bedside light.  They hadn't asked what was wrong, what weighed so heavily on Veri's mind.  Instead they shouted for darkness and peace.  Veri tossed and turned in the dark, knowing it was fruitless.  When the sun rose, he was already cleaned and dressed.  The cab was to arrive an hour after sunrise.  He was ready for it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The cab, as it turned out, was not a cab at all, but a bus.  Inside, two older people had already found seats.  Veri entered, fingering his envelope, clinging to it as if it were the only thing keeping him there.  Which, he thought, it was.  The driver took it without a word or smile, scanned it, and nodded Veri to the back with a soft grunt.  He took a seat away from the other occupants, who were watching him curiously.  One leaned over and whispered something to the other.  She giggled.  Veri blushed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">By the end of the following hour, the bus had collected three others: an older, darker man, and two women, one obese and unkempt, the other smoking a cigar.  Veri found it odd that a woman should smoke a cigar.  No one had yet talked to him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The obese woman took the empty seat next to Veri.  He pushed away to make room.  Comfortable, she looked down and smiled.  A fake, greasy smile.  Veri tried not to cringe, knowing it would have been rude.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's your name?\" the woman asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri told her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are you alone?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He nodded.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I suppose they don't let anyone come with you, even though you are so young.\"  She had a slight accent, like the women Veri saw in the market sometimes that liked to buy the cheap jewelry and clothing sold by the sleazy venders.  \"How old are you?\" she went on.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Eight,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She hummed and tsked, muttering to herself about how a child so young shouldn't be off on his own.  Veri didn't understand why she thought this; he was often alone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My name is Milly,\" she said suddenly, breaking out of her musings.  \"It's short for Milton, which is my last name.  First name's Edith, though, so no one calls me that.  And since Milton is a boy's name, it's Milly.\"  She grinned again.  Slimy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri watched her.  Cautious.  She seemed the type of woman who would pinch his cheek or wrap him in a hug without asking.  Sometimes the tourists in his village would do that while telling him how cute he was and how they were going to bring him home with them, feed him until he was plump and greasy like they were.  They rarely fed him and never took him home. He had become wary.  Milly was like them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ahead of them, Veri could see the long stretch of desert that marked the borderline between the place he knew of as home and the place he was told he must never go.  There was very little out in the desert, his father had told him, and it was dangerous.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Through the low-lying clouds of unsettled sand, Veri made out the thin, dark line of the Elevator. Some fifty miles distant, but still just visible.  He had seen pictures of it, an old, rusty piece of garbage, but never thought to get any closer.  Not that he would have been able to get very close.  Security fences were constructed around the property, five miles on a side.  Or so the rumor went.  He wasn't sure what to make of it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do you know what to expect?\" Milly asked.  She had been silent for several minutes.  Veri had almost forgotten that she was there.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He shook his head.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I suppose no one does, but I can tell you what I heard. And my source is reliable.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The others in the bus stopped conversing.  Everyone wanted to know what Milly had heard.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The reason why no one ever talks about what they've seen at the Elevator is because they never come back,\" Milly began.  \"It goes up and up, out of this planet, and to a space station in orbit.  And, from what I've heard, this space station is a true paradise.  They call it Sion, or Zion, whichever you please.  People live like they're meant to, in gardens with nature.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well now,\" the older, darker man interrupted.  \"How is it nature if it's in space?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Milly frowned, annoyed.  \"I suppose they took a chunk of nature from the planet here and put it up there.\"  As if it was obvious.  As if such things could be done.  \"So people go up the Elevator to paradise.  Utopia! Sion.  That's why no one ever talks about it.  Cause they can't! They never come back.\"  She nodded emphatically, smiling her smile.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If that's true,\" the older woman with the dark man said, \"then how did we all get selected?  We didn't pass any test or anything.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can't let everyone into paradise,\" Milly replied.  \"Then it wouldn't be paradise anymore.  It'd turn into the mess we've made of Earth.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The people in the bus began whispering to one another, throwing the atmosphere back into a clutter.  Static.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri watched them speak, afraid to join in.  Milly bent down into a bag and pulled out a container of food.  She began eating it noisily.  Veri wished he could move away.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">What if Milly were right?  Veri worried.  He hadn't told anyone that he was going to the Elevator.  If he never returned, his parents would worry.  His brothers and sisters would worry.  He wondered if the Elevator people would let him write a letter or make a call.  They couldn't force him to go without letting him contact someone, he reasoned.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He mulled this over, growing more and more concerned as the bus bounced along the poorly kept road.  It was uncomfortable.  The seats were not very well-padded, and he could feel the springs poking into his behind.  Beside him, Milly was pushing the last of her meal into her mouth.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'll tell you what we heard,\" spoke up the dark man.  \"Ada here was told by our pastor that the Elevator is God's final gift to man.  Now, I know you all can't be believers like us, but hear me out.  Maybe Milly isn't so far off the mark, anyway.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Let me tell it, Evan,\" interrupted Ada.  The dark man nodded, gesturing for her to go on.  \"Our pastor, he told me that the Elevator was built by God to bring the few remaining worthy back to Heaven.  Since He's given up on Man, the Elevator is a final gift to us few deserving folk.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Load of rubbish,\" Milly replied.  \"How could God build an elevator?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not God,\" Ada said.  \"But he sent instructions to men through his messengers.  Men--good, holy men--took these instructions and built the Elevator to bring them back to God.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If God wanted to bring some of us to Heaven, why not just do it?\" Milly shot back.  Veri caught the skepticism in her voice.  \"You fanatics\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Watch it, now,\" Evan replied.  \"We didn't make fun of your ideas.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"They aren't my ideas.  They're what I heard.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Regardless\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, cut it out,\" the woman with the cigar scolded in a deep Russian accent.  \"Getting heated over it isn't going to get us anywhere.  Let us have a pleasant trip, and whatever comes will.  Shall we?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I agree,\" said the last man, who had not spoken until now.  Like Veri, he was seated against the window.  \"Let's have a pleasant trip,\" he repeated.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Well, what have you two heard?\" Ada asked, her voice a forced calm, her head turned purposefully away from Milly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman chewed the cigar for a moment, letting tendrils of smoke fall from parted lips onto her chest.  \"Well, firstly, let me introduce myself.  I'm Konstance Tsiolkovsky.  It's a pleasure to meet you all.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was general agreement.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So what have you heard?\" Evan prompted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Something like what Milly heard.  Are you familiar with the concept of a space elevator?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Of course, we're all educated people,\" Milly replied shortly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ada scoffed.  \"I'm not familiar with the term.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Milly snorted, amused, vindicated.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"A space elevator is an elevator that is tethered to a weight that is out in orbit.  The idea is to reduce the need for rockets to get off the planet, so space exploration becomes more cost effective.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And you believe that the Elevator is going to bring us out to space?\" Ada replied.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why not?  There aren't many other places to go when you go up.\"  She smiled.  Veri felt a warmth from her, despite the cigar.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And what is waiting for us up in space, then?\" Evan asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What I told you,\" Milly said.  \"Sion.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, no.  That is not what I heard,\" Konstance said.  \"No, I heard that we have been selected for a long-term mission to other planets.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" Milly stood up.  \"That's insane! Why, that's kidnapping!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Now calm down,\" Evan replied, pushing his hands down at her.  \"Let Konstance finish.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You all know that our planet is sick.  Dying from the abuse we've dealt it these past few centuries.  We've all been chosen for a long-term mission to explore other planets.  To look for a place that we might move to someday.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That doesn't make sense,\" Milly muttered.  \"They wouldn't have picked random people for something like that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Desperate times\u2026\" Konstance began.  \"Maybe there are no volunteers.  Earth is in such a state now, who has the time or effort to spend?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Again, the bus erupted into conversation.  Milly leaned around the edge of the seat to speak with Konstance, leaving Veri to his thoughts.  Not knowing how to feel, he turned to watch the desert roll by.  He was surprised to see the Elevator was now much closer.  So close he could make out its shape.  They would soon be at the entrance gate.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri tried to reconcile the conflicting ideas.  He hadn't put a lot of thought into what the Elevator might bring him, or where.  Just riding was so great a feat that the possible consequences had eluded him.  Now he was scared.  He didn't want to populate a new planet or go to Heaven.  His family was not religious, and he doubted that Heaven would have him.  What if, he now wondered, he was rejected?  What would happen to him?  Hell?  Had anyone ever been rejected before?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The bus slowed.  Ahead, Veri saw a guard station pressed inside a wire-mesh fence topped with barbed wire.  As they pulled closer, he could make out lightning-bolt wooden signs peppered along the fence.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The bus stopped and the driver exited.  A guard approached, gesturing.  Talking. Veri wondered what they might be talking about.  Then the driver handed the guard a stack of papers.  Veri recognized the letter from his envelope.  The guard took the papers into the guard tower, leaving the driver alone.  They waited.  Sandy wind tugged at the driver's pant legs.  He seemed indifferent.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The guard returned several minutes later and boarded the bus, following the driver.  He now had a clipboard.  The bus went quiet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"All right,\" he began.  \"You've all been pre-scanned before getting on the bus, but now I need to verify who you are.  Please take out some form of identification.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">People rustled, searching pockets and purses.  Veri stared at the guard.  He hadn't brought anything.  He didn't own any sort of identification.  Tears rushed to his eyes.  He was going to be turned away! Rejected before he even reached the Elevator!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The guard surveyed the group over the lip of his clipboard.  His eyes settled on Veri.  \"Oh, right,\" he said.  Milly looked up from her purse.  \"You are\u2026 Veri\u2026 um\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yessir,\" Veri said quietly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I take it you don't have identification?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Nosir.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The guard nodded.  \"There is a note to allow you through anyway.  Your situation was pre-approved before the acceptance letter was issued.  No worries, son.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And as soon as it had come, the worry was gone.  Veri wiped his eyes, shocked by the sudden reversal of fate.  Someone was watching over him.  <i>Perhaps,</i> he thought, <i>Ada and Evan were right.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The guard walked down the aisle, glancing at identification cards.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mister\u2026 Cahnt, is it?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Very good, sir.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The guard finished with the final man and turned to leave.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Have a good trip, everyone,\" he said before exiting.  Outside, the gate rose to permit the bus through.  The driver rolled on.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Cahnt, huh?\" Milly said.  \"We haven't heard what you think yet.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Call me Manny,\" the man said.  \"Everyone else does.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So what have you heard, then, Manny?\" Evan asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Nothing like what you've all heard, anyway,\" he began in an offhand, distant way.  \"I don't believe that the Elevator is going to take us to some destination.  I've heard that it is\u2026 more of a ride, than anything.  But a ride of a lifetime.  When riding the Elevator up and up, we are exposed to rare knowledge.  Maybe the meaning of life.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" Ada asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe the Elevator doesn't even go anywhere.  Maybe it's all just for show.  It's possible, after all.  The meat of the thing is to reveal information to us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But\u2026 why?\" Milly asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why not?  If you knew the meaning of life, wouldn't you want to tell someone?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe, but why in such a manner?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Because,\" Manny went on, \"It's a distraction, you see.  If everyone knew that this whole organization is in place to reveal the meaning of life, there would be an uproar.  People would demand to know!  But by disguising it, it becomes more of a simple curiosity.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Boy, that's the damndest thing I've ever heard,\" Evan said, and whistled through his teeth.  \"You the kind of kid who'd do back flips to convince himself gravity ain't real.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No sir, I don't believe so.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Milly was shaking her head, laughing.  It was a mean laugh, and Veri was frightened.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri hadn't taken note of their proximity to the Elevator since passing the guard station, and was surprised to find that they had arrived.  The bus pulled to a stop several yards from the base.  A splintered wooden path ran between the bus and the Elevator, covering the sand floor of the desert.  The sand had not been so easily deterred, though, and had recovered the wooden planks on their edges.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri exited the bus behind Milly and stared.  The Elevator grew straight up from the desert, disappearing far overhead into a group of passing clouds.  There was not a lot to see.  The base of the Elevator was rusty and old.  It didn't look as though anyone had used it in many years.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A dull weight fell on his chest.  He had been expecting something more glamorous.  A fanfare.  Fireworks, perhaps.  But here he saw the neglected shell of metal as a sign of defeat.  A relic from a people far removed from himself.  A people with the means and talent to build an Elevator so high that it may have reached the stars.  But now those people were gone, replaced by a new people who debated the meaning behind the thing.  Veri felt the weight in his chest swell, threatening to pour out in a new fit of tears--tears for the glory of the past and its death in the hands of the present.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Please step up to the Elevator doors,\" a voice said.  Startled, Veri looked around, trying to locate its source.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Who said that?\" Evan demanded.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Please step up to the Elevator doors,\" the voice repeated.  \"The Elevator will be opening shortly.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's up there,\" Milly pointed to a speaker mounted on the side of the Elevator's shaft.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Are we alone here?\" Ada asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It appears so,\" Konstance replied, and brushed past the rest.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What are you doing?\" Evan yelled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What it told us to do.\"  The others hesitated a moment before following.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Gathered before the doors to the Elevator, the group was nervous.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Who do you think made this thing?\" Milly asked quietly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We are already pretty sure about that,\" Ada replied.  She hooked her arm through Evan's.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What about the rest of you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Konstance shrugged.  \"Great scientists of the past, I suppose.  People who wanted to explore the universe.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Or people who just wanted to prove that they could,\" Manny interjected.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Something like this just to say we told you so?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sure, why not?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What a waste.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So says you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A churning sound started behind the doors.  Old machines groaning to life, fighting the rust and sand that had built up since it was last summoned to work.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Milly took a step back.  \"We're going to ride up on that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Plenty of others have already done it,\" Konstance pointed out.  \"It's safe.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"How do you know? Maybe we never hear back from them because they all fell to their deaths!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Manny said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The doors creaked open.  Inside was dimly lit.  Small folding chairs had been set along the wall.  Six of them.  A young black man in a business suit stood in the center of the carriage, smiling.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Welcome to the Elevator,\" he said.  \"You lucky six have been chosen among the millions who applied to ride the Elevator.  Are you ready?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The group eyed the man.  Milly was still backed away from the rest.  Konstance again broke the reverie and breeched the doorway.  The Elevator did nothing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"See, it is safe,\" she called back to Milly.  Milly looked at her from around the backs of the others.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, get off it,\" Evan said eventually.  \"We've come this far.\"  This broke the trance, and the group boarded the Elevator.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">With their seats taken, the six stared across the open floor at each other.  The man who had greeted them was in the doorway, giving a lecture about safety.  He would not, he told them, ride the Elevator.  However, he would be in constant contact via a small intercom.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When the doors closed, several of the group let out a collective breath.  Veri shifted uneasily in his folding chair.  Sand had snuck into the Elevator car and was scattered around their feet.  It struck him odd that no one cared to sweep it out.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A soft humming announced that the Elevator had been turned on.  It would not be much longer before they lifted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We never asked you what you thought, Veri,\" Milly mentioned, breaking the silence.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri looked up from the sand on the floor.  He frowned, unsure of what to say.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah, what do you think, young man?\" Evan added.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I\u2026 I don't know,\" Veri stammered.  \"I'll be happy with anything, I guess.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ha, cute kid,\" Evan chuckled.  Ada smiled.  Milly sighed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The Elevator lurched, made a loud chrunk, and began to rise.  No countdown, no warning.  It just started to go up.  Veri clutched his seat.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Evan and Ada began praying quietly.  Evan pulled a pocket Bible from somewhere and started referencing it.  Milly had found another packet of food and was eating slowly.  Veri doubted she tasted it.  Konstance chewed on the remains of her cigar thoughtfully, while Manny shared Veri's gaze of the sand-covered floor.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After a minute or two, a new mechanical noise startled the group.  Behind Evan and Ada, a panel shifted haltingly to reveal a window.  Sunlight began filling the small car.  Veri blinked against it, his eyes watering in protest.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My God,\" Manny said quietly, standing for a better view.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ha,\" Evan grunted loudly, sarcastically.  He turned, though, and, greeted with the view, went quiet.  The rest joined him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The bottom of the window was just under the bridge of Veri's nose.  He stood on his toes to see out, still urging his eyes to adjust to the glare.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He had never been in a plane or any tall buildings.  The poor, small village that he'd grown up in was located in what was once known as a third-world country, but now represented the commonality of Man's glory.  No such opportunities were ever offered to Veri, and now, faced with the unfamiliar vertigo, he stepped away.  It was too new, too unexpected.  He began shaking uncontrollably.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Konstance, sensing his discomfort, put a strong hand on his shoulder.  He looked up at her curiously.  She smiled down at him, flecks of chewed cigar cracking away from the line of her lips.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This is amazing.\" Ada broke the silence.  \"How can you not believe in the divinity of God when faced with such awesomeness?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">No one bothered to reply.  Konstance urged Veri forward again, pushing him slightly.  He took a breath, held it, and returned to the window.  This time, ready for the sensation, he managed to brace himself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Outside, small, pathetic clouds whipped by the Elevator as it traversed the shaft.  Already, the car was more than a mile above the desert floor, and gaining height with every passing moment.  From this altitude, the group could see the distant ocean, unmoving and beautiful in its natural glory.  A mountain range whose name had been long forgotten spread out beneath them to the east, lining the ocean as one might expect of a beach.  The snowy peaks reflected the sun to the water, and the water replied in much the same way.  Veri gasped, stunned by the simple, ancient beauty.  From this distance, the influence of Man was hardly relevant.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And still the elevator rose.  The light boundary created by the limitations of the sun made itself known to the immediate west, creeping slowly across the planet.  Veri could sense the curve of the globe pulling away.  Falling away.  His vertigo was renewed, but he ignored it--the spectacle was too great to cower in a corner.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You are now reaching the eighth mile of the journey,\" the black man's voice said from the ceiling speaker.  Veri expected more information, but none came.  He suspected that nothing more needed to be said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ada began to weep.  Veri did not understand why, exactly, but he shared the inclination.  The men blinked against their own tears, unwilling to let them fall.  And suddenly Veri knew that it did not matter which of them had been right about the Elevator.  Now they were all human, sharing the experience regardless of what they believed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The atmosphere suddenly divided, revealing the brilliant darkness of space as a crescent wrapped around Earth's glow.  Veri could make out the brightest of the stars, millions of lifetimes distant.  At the very limit of his perception, he saw the edge of Luna moving away through the still-dark half of the planet.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Features began to blur.  The mountain range had fallen into the surrounding land, creating a peppered green landscape outlined by a steady blue ocean.  And still further the curve of the planet grew, the crescent of space progressed, and the Elevator rose.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When it stopped, the group's emotions were worn thin.  The women were openly weeping, the men exasperated.  Veri remained at the window, taking everything in.  The planet was enormous beneath him, rotating slowly through the field of stars and space.  The sun had disappeared behind them somewhere, allowing pinpoints of light to shine through the blackness.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The speaker crackled, breaking the silence.  \"You are removed from the surface of Earth at a distance of sixteen miles.  We hope you have enjoyed your journey.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The speaker went silent.  The room, too, was quiet for a moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And a tension rose, swiftly, startlingly.  The atmosphere of the small car turned poisonous, disgusted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's it?\" Milly said, outrage creeping into her tone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This is ridiculous,\" Evan said, shaking away whatever glory had held him captive moments earlier.  \"Nothing happened!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's a hoax!\" Ada added.  \"A joke!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Konstance, too, looked disappointed.  \"Apparently we've been had,\" she said softly.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Evan began shouting, proclaiming loudly the numbers he had spent on this trip.  How he had been wronged and the important people he would call.  Ada nodded emphatically, and Milly announced that she would join them in retaliation.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And Veri continued to look out the window, his mind suspended.  So far from humanity, and still people remained selfish and ignorant.  Materialistic.  Veri could not understand why they felt so cheated.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Veri, you must help too,\" Milly screamed, comfortable in her hysteria.  \"We'll need as many accounts of this scam as we can get!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Veri turned now from the window to look at the faces of his fellow travelers.  He knew that they would not raise allegations against the Elevator's founders.  Nothing was ever promised.  Ruined hopes and beliefs were no ground for retribution.  And once their glorious bantering and hotly fueled indignation had passed, they would be embarrassed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That was, of course, why no one ever talked about what happened on the Elevator.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Veri?\" Milly repeated.  \"Will you help us?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Is this all that there is to Man? he wondered.  Is this what we've become?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Tears took shape in the corners of his eyes.  He shook his head, answering Milly, answering himself.  Because there does not need to be anything else, and it is sad--heartbreaking--that only he, a poor child from a forgotten desert town at the edge of the world, understood.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/erik-m-igoe/the-elevator", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Joshua Hemmings and Beverly Amherst climbed up and up and up. They had spent weeks devising a plan to avoid the elders who would have kept them from venturing to the surface. In a thousand years, a lot could change. Whatever catastrophes had occurred in the past would have healed by now, the surface returning to its pristine, life-filled abundance. A new Eden awaited.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Their entire population had moved underground over a thousand years before. Thanks to a steady degradation of their technological assets, due to a lack of production facilities and spare parts, it only took a few hundred years to forget their past, forget the surface, and forget where they came from. All they had were the few books they discovered in their library, a rare resource in light of the digitization of all knowledge into a wonderfully handy and portable, but ultimately irreparable, technology.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The physical resources given highest priority were their thermoelectric generators, tapping the core's heat to light the lights, grow the plants, and circulate the air that kept them alive. While their scientists had lacked design data on the generators and pumps, they learned what they had to to duct-tape them into functionality.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But for Jeremy and Beverly, the books from the library opened up an entrancing view of the surface of Earth. Trees and flowers in abundance, animals wandering wild on the Earth's surface, and nothing they could find about why they ended up down here in the darkness in the first place. If the information ever existed, it was lost with the electronic files centuries before. Now there were only tales told by the elders, warning them of the dangers of the surface. \"Don't leave the city!\" they would warn. \"Only death awaits.\" An ambiguous, undefined death.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joshua was surprised to see that the metal ladders progressing ever upward had survived a thousand years. Even the rock in which they were mounted seemed more worn than the metal. Dim lights still lit the wide shaft, their permanence and utility attestation to the capabilities of the original engineers. Motes of ancient dust swirled in the cool, dry air. He glanced down at Beverly and said, \"I expected these ladders to be completely rusted through. No corrosion or anything.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This doesn't look like the metal we use at home.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He examined the ladder under his sweating grip. \"Maybe you're right.\" He hung his arm over the rung and sighed heavily. \"My arms and legs are ready to drop off.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Beverly, five rungs below him, pointed. \"I think I see something ahead. Is that a door?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Joshua climbed up and stepped out onto a platform. He walked carefully over to the vertical hatch, gripping the railing tightly, still not trusting the strange metal of the walkway. There was a large metal wheel in the center of the hatch. He dropped his backpack to the floor and leaned on the wheel, grateful that the long climb might finally be over.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You think this really leads outside?\" He ran his fingers over a plastic sign next to the door. Unlike the ladder, the sign had long ago cracked, discolored and fractured to an unreadable haze.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We've been climbing for hours. I hope so,\" she sighed. \"Wait until the elders hear what we found!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Huh. I'm not sure I'm going back to tell them.\" He grabbed the large wheel and grunted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We should.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Help me,\" he said. She grabbed the wheel, too, and together they slowly rotated it. It squealed with ancient age. They pulled against the door, and it slowly swung open. A puff of dust swirled out from behind it.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hmm.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's another door.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They stepped inside a small chamber and examined the next door, which had an identical wheel in the middle. At the side of the smaller chamber they now occupied was a button, with the remnants of a cracked and illegible label above it. Joshua pushed the button. Nothing happened.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They spun the next hatch-wheel until it stopped, then pulled against the door. It wouldn't budge.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Maybe the other door needs to be shut,\" Jeremy suggested.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They swung the inner door shut, finding themselves in pitch blackness, and pulled on the outer door again. It still wouldn't move.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Jeremy pushed the button again. A hissing sound emanated from a vent above his head. \"Guess that was it,\" he said. He smiled, satisfied, and put his arm around Beverly's shoulders. She snuggled into him, waiting expectantly for the first look at the surface in a thousand years.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After a few minutes, the outer door popped open an inch. Air from the chamber wafted out and condensed in a white layer below the frame of the door. All was silent.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Outside, Mars waited patiently.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/thomas-f-jolly/surface", "title": null},

I read the news. I didn't know anyone else who could still speak, so I figured I was just behind the curve.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It wasn't until this month that she finally accepted the truth. Abello, like an estimated three percent of the world's population, seems to be immune to the Global Apraxia of Speech.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Now, the Toronto pediatrician is urging the world's governments to keep funding research and find what Abello calls a \"cure\" for a condition that is now nearly universal.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The British writer and activist Alden Hood recently wrote in The Guardian that \"to look upon the mass of humanity as being somehow deficient because they are changed is to indulge in a new and brutally nostalgic form of elitism. It is not speech that makes us human, but language.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">RELATED LINKS:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">THE FIRST ALL CGI-SPEECH MOVIE HITS THE BOX OFFICE</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">TEN WAYS THE APRAXIA HAS CHANGED GEOPOLITICS</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">EXPLAINER: LOST VOICES, NEW WORDS</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Abello subscribes to the theory that the Apraxia came from some external contamination or infection, perhaps carried through proteins, similar to the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Critics of that theory, such as Toronto's medical officer of health, Joanne Lew, point out that unlike other so-called prion diseases, the Apraxia does not seem to be degenerative. The fact that humans with Apraxia have maintained their ability to read, write and understand spoken speech makes Lew skeptical of the infection theory.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"These are isolated changes to a very specific part of the brain that we're seeing,\" says Lew, \"the kind you might expect from a stroke or trauma. It's almost as if a tiny, precise bomb went off in every human brain at the same moment.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Or almost every human brain.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lew does not directly respond to questions about terrorists or aliens, but says, in an email that echoes the carefully coordinated media \"lines\" from every health department in the country, that those who are searching for a cure may be deluding themselves--and worse, wasting time and resources that could be better spent on adaptation.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We need to make sure that all people, in all countries, have access to text-to-speech and to instruction in signing,\" says UN Special Envoy Tina Badely. \"What we've seen so far is that the Apraxia has a tendency to reinforce inequality.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">INFOGRAPHIC: BROCA'S AREA</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So far, no other neurological effects have been reported, although Abello points out that the Apraxia only started showing up less than a year ago.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Who knows how long it was dormant, or what its progression might be?\" she wonders.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">This kind of warning is what some, such as Alden Hood, dismiss as \"fearmongering.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"People are shocked when I say we got lucky, but what I mean is that we're lucky it came when it did,\" he says in an email interview. \"The Apraxia hit when humanity had already reached a stage in its evolution that made oral communication obsolete. There is text-to-speech software for those who want it but I don't think we'll be using it in a generation or two. We're a text-based society anyway.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Abello disagrees. She says she finds it difficult to treat her young patients now, because many are too young to text quickly enough to communicate their symptoms or respond to her questions on their own--although many are already learning to sign. She admits that one reason for her drive to find a cure is personal.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm lonely,\" she says. \"I miss talking to my husband, really talking. I'm an extrovert, I guess. And I'm worried about what all this will mean to the bean.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She smiles and rubs her belly, where \"the bean\"--due in February--is growing. Abello shyly agrees to sing a lullaby (see video) to her belly. She says she plans to speak to the child when it is born, whether or not it has the Apraxia.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Her husband, Dave Goodman, says he is comfortable with this, and he plans to use text-to-speech around the baby as much as possible himself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm not going to insist that our child learn to speak,\" he says, using his text-to-speech app as we sit in the family's suburban living room. \"But I want to give it the best chance possible. We know that language is related to all kinds of development. Can we just take that out? Can our child learn to text at four or five, when he or she has never learned to speak?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"This is why we're worried about the long-term effects beyond our generation,\" cuts in Abello, clearly losing patience with the slowness of her husband's text-to-speech app.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Before the interview ends, Goodman coos a little to his wife's belly, just a string of jumbled sounds but somehow soothing all the same.

Lately, I met a being on Celsia 9 who exists midway between a corporeal and non-corporeal state. That is, he/she/it (undetermined) feels more like liquid than solid and is somewhat permeable. We don't really speak directly, instead doing a kind of mime of what we want. It's a slow and interesting process. Since this is a new contact, there is no handbook on what any of this means, but I have been feeling more and more like staying on this planet rather than continuing to explore. Oddly enough, all my crewmates feel the same way and we have wondered if there might be more to this attraction than we're aware of.

Very often, gods can start by creating miracles and getting followers. It wants you for a priest, of course, so it's trying to impress you. If it's a sacrificial god, however, it will sacrifice you once it convinces you of its powers. It's already halfway there, honey.  And maybe you should be sacrificed, come to think of it, considering your predilections. But I'm concerned about your companions; it could get messy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">If it's a changing god, you could go through a number of transformations, some of which will be uncomfortable.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">If it's a warrior god, you will find an army outside your room one morning.

In this case, the opposite applies. Jarold meant to harm Jed (and why did you two go up on the roof with him, anyway?).

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Saturday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia held her wrist up to the security panel outside the pharmaceutical club and waited while her identification and prescription were verified. A light on the panel flashed twice. The airlock doors opened. She closed her eyes as the doors slid shut behind her and the airwash kicked on, stripping the pollutants from her skin and clothing. It finished with a high-pitched beep and a rush of cool air. She tugged off her breathing mask. Another door opened, revealing a small, dark lobby and a guard with shoulders nearly the width of her apartment's front door.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She'd offer him a smile, but inside, she was Empty. It would take too much energy to fake.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She extended her arm, wrist up. The guard double-checked her information with a portable scanner. A hostess, her anorectic absence of curves accented by a form-fitting dress, led her through another door into the club itself, a wide room of dim lighting, plush seating, and dark papered walls. Classical music played overhead, something sad and mournful and filled with violins, muffling the sound of splintering glass. Although it was still early in the evening, patrons filled nearly every sofa and chair. Traces of scent hovered in the air--aromatic tobacco, cologne, ripe fruit, ink, and paper.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A few minutes after Mia took the proffered seat, another waitress approached her table and scanned the chip in her wrist again. Though it was all but impossible for an Impure to sneak past the security guards, government regulations and the insurance companies dictated the multiple checks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The waitress returned to Mia's table with a padded box in her hands. The dozen spheres within, each the size of a small orange, gleamed with secret fire. Inside the glass, colors swirled--sapphire, a red so deep it was almost black, pale champagne gold, dark green laced with lighter strands, lavender. Mia ran her hand over the tops, her palm skimming the surfaces. The colors intensified in response to her touch. She indicated her choice with the tap of one finger, and the waitress removed it from the box with a gloved hand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia cupped the glass in her palms; the golden vapor inside spun clockwise. Perhaps it was silly, taking the time to pick. Most people grabbed either their favorite color or something to match their outfits. In truth, it didn't matter. Behind the glamour, the contents were the same.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The waitress brought over a goblet of wine, the purple-red liquid filled almost to the rim, and a small vial of pale powder. Mia sprinkled the contents of the vial into the wine. The powder, also prescription, was used to counteract some of the side effects of the Break.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia lounged back in her chair, listening to the music while the sphere warmed against her skin. The breaker, jutting up from the middle of the table, was an elegant twist of wrought iron with dagger shaped edges blooming from the top like petals. As always, a shiver raced up and down her spine as she held the sphere to the breaker and gave a tiny tap. Glass shattered down to the table. The scent of jasmine and gardenia filled the air.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The gold hung on the edge of the breaker like a drop of rain. She leaned over the table, opened her mouth slightly, and inhaled. A thin ribbon of gold unwound from the top; the end slipped between her lips, filling her mouth with a taste like honey laced with lemon, the taste, like the scents, an additive to enhance the experience. A pretty fa\u00e7ade to camouflage the truth.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The rest of the gold uncoiled, floating in the air like an apple peeled in one long strip. She inhaled until nothing remained but a lingering trace of flowers and leaned back against the cushions.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A dark haired man, handsome in a boyish way, sat down on the chair across from her, broke open his sphere, and inhaled its contents through his nose.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia closed her eyes, feeling the subtle shift inside, a warmth settling deep within. The Break took over:</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026A gentle touch, soft whispers, a kind smile.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026The sharp snap of bone, white-bright pain shuddering beneath the skin, high-pitched cries of alarm, fading grey beneath the pain.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Laughter bubbling up, rising hard and fast, too much to hold in.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Harsh words, the hard stone of hurt, hot, swollen eyes, the taste of tears.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026A chill of anticipation, lips touching, skin prickling with inner heat.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Shadows and grey, an unexpected movement seen from the corner of the eye, breath caught in the throat, pulse racing.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Bodies entwined, spine arching, a knot of pleasure pulling tighter and tighter, releasing into shaking and liquid warmth.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026A slick surface, legs sliding out, hands outstretched, falling down.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Warm hands holding close, skin pressed to skin.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Clenched fists, voices rising up and up and up.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Fragile steps, aching movements, the world turned to blur and mute confusion.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Daggers of pain digging in hard and fast, a pulsing beat, a wordless, guttural cry.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>\u2026Empty. A vast pit of nothing. The absolute absence of sensation, yet a sensation in and of itself. A profound deprivation.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then it was gone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">With a cry, Mia opened her eyes and exhaled a small cloud of gold dust motes. They hovered in the air around her face then winked out, one by one.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Well and truly gone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For the now.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Slowly, the club's muted din crept back into her consciousness. The music, the intoxicating smells left behind by the Break, and a mix of sweat, exhilaration, and contentment from the patrons who were finished. In truth, Break was a misnomer. It didn't shatter them. It made them whole, even if only a temporary fix. Lab-created emotions were better than none at all.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But the Break could only give so much. If used more than once a week, suicide was a certainty, yet without it, society couldn't function.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia took several deep breaths, wiped the sweat from her brow, and took a large gulp of wine.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She felt human. She felt real.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Intense?\" the dark haired man asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She smiled. A real smile, not a mirror construct. \"Very.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He lifted his half-empty glass. \"To your mental health.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And to yours.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Two sofas over, a young girl, the traces of babyfat still on her cheeks, inhaled, then clamped her hands over her mouth and lurched to her feet, bolting for the restroom.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Everyone vomited the first time. Everyone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">On the bus ride home, Mia rested her head back against the seat. The interior of the bus was papered with signs, all of which read <i>Break. Stay Healthy. Stay Alive.</i> And in small print: <i>Brought to you by Dartwell Pharmaceutical.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Outside the windows, buildings passed by in a blur of brick and concrete. In the old city, streets had been choked with barely moving vehicles, the sidewalks with a sea of moving flesh. No one walked the streets now if they didn't have to. Even though the war was a faded story in history's pages, the air still bore the scars. Purifiers ran non-stop to strip away the pollution and toxins, but the results would not be seen by her generation or the next.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Before the war, the city had held darkness, too, albeit of a different sort: Strangers lurking in shadows, preying on anyone at any time. People sleeping in doorways, huddled against the cold. Or so she'd read.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The bus slowed, approaching a stop, and passed a cleaning crew, their red coveralls an advertisement for the tragedy. Mia averted her eyes from the still wet bloodstains on the pavement and felt the sting of tears. She hoped it wasn't someone she knew. Several other passengers gasped and she heard soft sobs from someone in the very back, muffled behind her breathing mask.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Once home, safe inside the filtered air of her shoebox-sized apartment, she tossed her breathing mask on the counter and took her vitamins. Like the Break, they were prescription; unlike it, they were approved for home use.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She sat on her bed with her legs tucked up underneath and took deep breaths in and out. Warmth clung to the corners of her mind like a soft blanket. Filling her up. Keeping her safe.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She laughed, a high-pitched, childlike sound, smiled, stretching the grin as wide as she could, then frowned, then threw her head back and laughed. The memory of the bloodstains on the pavement surfaced, and she choked back a sob. She wished they'd find some way to keep them from happening. There had to be a way. Tears spilled down her cheeks. She wrapped her arms around herself and rocked slowly back and forth, caught up in grief and sorrow, yet grateful she could feel anything at all.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Sunday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The coffee shop was packed, every table filled, every employee moving to and fro, taking and filling orders. The hushed tones of conversation were punctuated with laughter. Mia pulled off her breathing mask as she passed through the airwash and took her place in line. When she stepped up to the counter, the barista gave her a smile. Mia offered the same in return.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">With coffee in hand and mask replaced, she left the shop behind and crossed the street. A small sign next to the ID scanner outside the indoor park read <i>No Impure</i>. And over the airlock entrance, a quote from the first post-war President: <i>We do not give up. We will salvage what is left of our country. We will make the air breathable again. We will keep our people safe and heal our wounds.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She stripped off her mask once inside. Smooth pseudoglass walls rose up into a high, arched ceiling; holographic images of a blue sky with fluffy white clouds, trees in full bloom, and flowering bushes played across the slick surface.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Drawing inspiration from pre-war style parks, there were park benches, a meandering path that wound its way round a small lake, and tree sculptures complete with roughened bark on their trunks and paper-thin leaves. A hint of roses kissed the air. An artificial scent, but pleasing nonetheless. The grass was real, however. She sat down on a bench, kicked off her shoes, and nudged her toes into the green.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After a few moments, a throat cleared. The dark haired man from the club stood nearby, a coffee cup in his hand. \"May I sit with you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes, please do.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's nice to see you here. I'm Zachary,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Butterflies fluttered in her stomach and her cheeks grew warm. \"Mia.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So what do you do?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I work in Records, data entry. And you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm a tech at the Euthanasia Clinic over on Crossford.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do you\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, I'm just a prep tech right now. One day, though, as long as I\u2026\" He shivered.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She tapped on the bench. \"For luck and good health.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A family walked past the bench, heading deeper into the park. The mother and father held hands; the children, four of them with one still in diapers, toddled along in front. The oldest child, a girl with blonde curls, turned and gifted Mia with a bright smile that turned into a string of giggles.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Zachary chuckled under his breath. The family passed out of eyesight and the child's laughter echoed away.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia fought the urge to run to the girl's side. To tell her to catch and hold her laughter and keep the memory forever, but it would be cruel. She wouldn't remember, once her body and mind left childhood behind. Time would stamp her body with curves and holes where emotions used to live. Then she'd Break to replace the missing pieces.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia brushed away the tears clinging to her lashes. Zachary placed one hand gently on her shoulder, and she leaned into his touch.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She woke in the middle of the night. Zachary slept on his back, with one hand over his head. She kissed his forehead and his lips curled into a smile.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Draping a sheet round her shoulders, she grabbed her breathing mask and headed out into the hallway and to the stairwell. Her bare feet made tiny taps on the stairs as she climbed up.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The door to the roof opened without a sound; the superintendent kept the hinges well oiled. She stopped a few feet away from the edge and tipped her head back. Above, a grey scrap of sky, illuminated by the city lights, covered the city like a dirty blanket. When she was small, her father had told her there were stars in the sky, tiny pinpricks of light shimmering in a velvet dark, hidden behind the pollution. He'd never seen them, but his father had when he was a small boy, before the war.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Maybe one night, the clouds would part for her and prove the words true.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She could not see beyond the city, with its endless rows of windowless buildings, but she knew what lived there. Piles of rubble, tainted earth, and poisoned air.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They were lucky, though. The war had swallowed some countries whole, leaving nothing but a name on a map to indicate they'd ever been there at all. Still other countries fell when the air turned toxic, because their governments had not been as quick to respond to the crisis.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But if they had known what the air would do to their people, would they have even tried to save them?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In the quiet, the air purifiers hummed and purred. One day, the air would be clean and safe. One day, too, so would the people.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She wanted a family. Children. She didn't want to end up a name on a list, a tiny sorrow in a world too Empty to care. She didn't want to have to Break to feel love or kindness.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Or hope.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Monday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In the morning, a faint hint of Zachary's sweat, the traces of their lovemaking, and the rumpled sheets were the only signs she'd not been alone. She pressed one hand to the pillow, which still held the impression of his head, and tears slipped down her cheeks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He hadn't even said goodbye. She held tight to the feeling, all the while knowing it would fade away, no matter how hard she tried to keep it close.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>John Karris, Jumper</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Derrick Smyth, Hanging</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia paused, her fingers barely touching her keypad. Hanging. How horrible. Why would anyone do that to themselves? Why didn't they call or go to one of the clinics? Swallowing the lump in the back of her throat, she made the necessary phone calls to verify the information, saved her entries to the database, and sent the updated data to the Reproductive Planning team.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When she left the building, she walked into a small crowd of protestors, waving hand-lettered signs, and shouting the slogans, their words clear without the protection of breathing masks. \"Break your habit!\" \"Our time is done!\" A protestor grabbed her arm and swung her around. The smell of his body, a rancid combination of onions and dirty shoes, pushed its way through her mask. She wrenched her arm free and stepped back, away from his glazed eyes, sunken cheeks, and slack jaw.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The earth is done with us,\" he said. \"We should leave her in peace.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The crowd broke into cheers. Her heart racing, she pushed her way through, one hand on her mask. In the distance, sirens pierced the air. The crowd shouted even louder.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They were the Impure. They refused to Break, claiming it against the laws of nature and a way for the government to control its people, yet even they could not fight the Empty. They turned to cheap, inferior drugs made in their dirty labs. Natural preventatives, they claimed. The man's face had been anything but natural. Their drugs didn't help; they simply turned them into lunatics, all laughter and tears and rage and hurt, all rushing in at the same time, a chaotic soup of emotions with no context and no control. And though the toxic air made their condition worse, they refused the protection of breathing masks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Fools, all of them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She broke free from the crowd and quickened her steps, checking over her shoulder until she knew she was safe.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Tuesday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She stepped off the bus outside her building to find the superintendent standing with his hands on his hips, glaring at the graffiti someone had painted on the brick. The words, messily scrawled in bright red paint, read: <i>Breakers Don't Care.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She frowned. The stupid Impure couldn't be satisfied with protests, which, while unpleasant, were still legal. No, they had to deface property, too.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The superintendent lifted a spray bottle, and the words ran down like ruby tears.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Wednesday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Authorities were called in to handle another protest today, this one in Center Square.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia watched as the news footage showed a large crowd of people, none with breathing masks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>The protest was led by former Dartwell researcher, Thomas Lassiter. He claimed that Dartwell had developed a vaccine against the Empty, but refused to release it to the public. The protest was broken up without injury and Lassiter, among others, was taken into police custody. A spokesperson from Dartwell vehemently denied his claim.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mia turned off the viewer with a shake of her head. If Dartwell had discovered a vaccine, of course they'd release it. Lassiter was simply a disgruntled ex-employee trying to make trouble. Her hands curled into fists and she clenched her jaw.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">They wouldn't force anyone to live this way if there was a cure. It would be monstrous. She stared down at her fists; the anger dripped away, like red letters on brick. She tried to grab hold, but it wouldn't stay.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lassiter should have made his announcement on a Monday, when everyone was full enough to care. She forced a laugh, the sound nothing more than a pitiful choke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Thursday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Before she left for work, she stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, curving her lips up into the facsimile of a smile.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Lift.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Drop.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She blinked at her reflection. A mask blinked back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She thought of Zachary and the way his lips felt against hers. A slow warmth coiled in her abdomen, and the corners of her lips curved up again. She nodded. Good, she still had that at least.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">For now.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Perhaps she should fast for a few days. Sometimes a quick shift in weight helped the effects of the Break linger a little longer.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When her building quieted for the night, she crept up to the roof and sat with her legs dangling over the edge.

Wrinkling her nose against the smell, she stepped over a splatter of red so as not to track the mess into her building. Several others did the same, their eyes blank above their breathing masks. A van pulled up to the curb, and several men in red coveralls stepped out to clean it up.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She'd see the name on her list next week, no doubt.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Saturday:</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In the morning, after she brushed her teeth, she made faces in the mirror. A smile. A frown. A grimace. She practiced laughing, her voice echoing off the tiles. She bent her head forward, her nose almost touching the glass, and searched for something, anything, within her eyes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A group of Impure were standing near the club's entrance, their arms locked together, chanting.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText \">I clenched my eyelids, and my memories trickled in.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">John Ashley. Twenty-three years old. Terminal cancer. Crying parents. Cryogenic storage. The first cold moment. The last brief hope: they would awaken me when they had the cure.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I tensed and shivered. \"How long?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">An old man touched my neck, and relaxation seeped from the touch. I mumbled, barely able to understand myself. \"Who are you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm your brother, Larry.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That was good. Peace surrounded me. A sketchy doubt arose as I drifted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I had no brother.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I do not know how long I struggled with groggy consciousness, but finally I reached a point where I managed to stay alert through the day. That night, I slept extremely well, and awoke refreshed the following morning.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The nurse entered my room loaded with a sponge and a container of soapy water. Often, I had seen her dour face during by bouts with consciousness. For some reason today, she looked younger and crisper.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Something special for me?\" I asked, happy to be able to talk. As usual, she did not speak.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Instead, she smiled, that thin, tolerant smile that shows no teeth, that reeks of efficiency. She set the water and sponge on the bedside table and pulled the top sheet from my bed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She leaned over me to straighten my pillow. This was new, no tightly buttoned uniform today. Rather, the open neck revealed her creamy cleavage for too short a moment.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She crumpled the sheet and tossed it to the floor as laundry. Then she took hold of my hospital gown and stripped me bare. My gown joined the sheet on the floor.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was surprised. When I had been a pre-med student--before the cancer, before the long sleep--the curriculum drummed privacy and modesty issues into us. I guessed that people now were not as worried about nudity.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Just as well. I expected the chill of the cool room to descend. Instead, my face flushed and heat rose to my cheeks when she thoroughly inspected me. She picked up the sponge and dipped it into the water.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A few strokes of the warm sponge along my underarms, neck, and chest, and the tension melted from me. I relaxed. While her left hand patted my chest, she ran the sponge across my ribs and onto my stomach. Her left hand glided to my throat. Immediately, I felt drowsy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The warm, friendly sponge moved down my stomach, over my thighs, and toward my perineum. I wanted to stay awake, but I couldn't. As I faded, I thought I heard her whisper, but I never saw her lips move.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Good boy. Clever boy. Thank you for cooperating.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">About two weeks later, I could walk unassisted, and Larry took me on my first outside sojourn. When he opened the door for me to pass, the bright morning sun blinded me. As my vision cleared, I digested the green wall that lay a hundred meters beyond the doorway.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Is that a forest?\" I asked. In my previous life I had seen a tree every now and then, but nothing like this.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He smiled and put his hand on my shoulder. \"One of our successes,\" he said. \"We're much better stewards of the planet. Some of those trees are thirty meters tall.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I could contain myself no longer. I blurted out the concern that I had concealed for weeks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Larry, I never had a brother. Perhaps the paperwork is screwed up, but I think you've confused me with someone else. I want to thank you for how well you've treated me, but . . .\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You didn't have a brother before you were frozen? Yes, I know you were an only child. But after your parents... lost you, they wanted another child. At their age, it was not an easy thing, but as proof, I stand here before you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I looked carefully at Larry. He looked much older than Dad had been the last time I saw him. Larry looked old enough to be my grandfather. The mirror told me that I was still the same scruffy twenty-three-year-old pre-med student who jumped into an icebox to avoid death. Well, maybe not quite the same. Healthwise, I felt a lot better.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Mom and Dad are gone... How long?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He sighed and turned from me. \"You've been in cold storage more than seventy-five years. Come on. Let's look about. I think you will find the environment exciting.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">More than seventy-five years? One hundred years is more than seventy-five years. One thousand years is more than seventy-five years. Was there some deception here? Just how much had medicine advanced? How far into the future had I travelled?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The doubts subsided as my surroundings compelled my attention. I had been a twenty-three-year-old kid teetering on the brink of death. I remembered those last frantic days of pain and exhaustion when my life rushed toward its close. Now, with firmer body, I stood on my own and looked at rebuilt forests.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I felt good. I felt hopeful.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A strange creature hopped from beneath a nearby bush and nibbled on a flower.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Another environmental success. Don't you recognize the animal from old pictures?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I examined the creature carefully. It regarded me with mismatched eyes, one sickly pink and one deep red. A short, tan ear perked at the left side of its head, and a longer, brown ear hung listlessly to the right. The hind legs seemed far out of proportion to the front legs, so that the creature sloped downhill. I struggled to retrieve an unfamiliar name.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Is it a rabbit?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Excellent. We are quite proud of the species' recovery. The population was down to three rabbits, one marginal male and two fertile females. Of course, with a small genetic pool, we had plenty of setbacks in the program. Intensive inbreeding produced many stillbirths and malformed offspring, but now each new rabbit generation is afflicted with fewer of the bad effects from recessive genes. Fortunately, as a regression offset, rabbits are prolific. The rabbit population today is just over a thousand, and the species will have a chance beyond mere survival. We hope someday they will thrive. Still, if we could introduce some fresh genetic material into the rabbit gene pool... Ah, well.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I looked back at the forest. How long did it take a tree to grow to thirty meters? How long had I slept?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">How old was my brother?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I first saw the woman during an after-lunch walk. She sat on a bench and fed breadcrumbs to small birds. The birds flew away when I approached.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I didn't mean to scare them.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She did not reply. With her back straight and stiff, she stared ahead. The wind ruffled her hair so that I could see the left side of her face better.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She looked about Mom's age, or at least the age at which I last remembered Mom. Wrinkles pulled at the corner of her eye, and she wore her skin more loosely than a young woman. I did not try to guess her age, but from her profile I suspected she had once been beautiful. Because of my experience with Larry, I was not sure I could judge age based on appearance. Clearly, she was another patient.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"My name is John, John Ashley. I've only been here a few. . .\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman rose and walked away. I had not noticed before, but she had a withered right leg, and she limped when she walked. Also, her right arm was conspicuously shorter than her left arm, and her right hand appeared incomplete.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I called after her. \"Please. Don't leave on my account. I didn't mean to. . .\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She glanced back over her right shoulder. A large scar dimpled and puckered the right side of her face. The scar continued above her mangled ear and left a large bald patch on the right side of her hairline.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I watched her until she turned the corner of the building.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">What kind of hospital was this?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"When can I leave?\" I suppressed 'when can I go home,' because I realized I no longer had a home. \"I feel much better now. I've been here for months. Except for an occasional headache or a little nausea, I feel great. I want to start a new life for myself.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Larry sat behind his desk and looked thoughtful, as if he needed to be careful of his response. He thinned his lips.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Few people get sick anymore, John.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's good. Is that why there are so few patients here?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes. Of course, but few patients mean medicine is no longer mass-produced. Each treatment must be a custom solution.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I said, \"I don't understand.\" But I thought I did understand. Perhaps I had not been cured. Perhaps my disease was simply treatable, and I would have to live my life with a chronic condition that needed to be controlled. Larry confirmed my diagnosis.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We are pleased with the remission of your cancer, but we hesitate to call you cured. Please give us a bit more time to study you, to design your treatment. I am afraid that you would not do nearly as well without our continuous supervision.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Supervision? That did not sound medical. Was he worried about how I would integrate into society? I had seen few other patients on the hospital grounds. Seldom would any speak with me. I suspected that this was not a hospital just for diseases of the body. None of the minds I met seemed healthy to me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But surely I was different from the mentally ill. On the other hand, maybe I was also different from everyone. Maybe that was the problem. The elapsed years had made me too different from those in the outside world. I told myself that with effort I would learn to adjust, to fit in. Confidence ebbed as I wondered how much the world had changed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Larry sought my attention. \"John.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Hmm.\" I remained distracted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"John, I think it best if you reconciled yourself to a longer stay. I know you didn't expect resurrection until we had a cure, but circumstances forced our decision and made the timing now or never. Perhaps it's difficult to see now, but I am sure that you will eventually agree that a longer stay here is for the best.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I read the concern on his face. Well, he was my brother. He would have my best interests at heart. I summoned a smile. \"Yes, Larry, I suppose you're right.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was lonely. The nurse never spoke, and I seldom saw Larry. I found comfort outside, near the forest. I walked slowly and quietly to avoid frightening the birds.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman sat on the same bench, feeding breadcrumbs to the birds with her left hand, and rubbing her stomach with her shriveled right hand. She turned her head to look at me full-faced. The scars on the right side of her face pulled at her lips.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Remember me? I'm John. I hope you will tell me your name.\" Maybe she did not speak English. Maybe no one except Larry spoke English anymore.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She stopped feeding the birds and regarded me for a long moment, but she continued to rub her stomach as she measured my face. Finally, she spoke.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Annie,\" she said, and then she emptied her hand of breadcrumbs. The birds fluttered in to retrieve the treasure.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Annie's accent was strange--not familiar like Larry's--and her pronunciation was either peculiar or distorted by the scars about her mouth. She wiped her hand on her skirt.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I'm pleased to meet you, Annie.\" I extended my hand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She ignored me to look at her stomach. She patted her stomach lightly. \"Howjado. Howjado. Now to meet your daddy?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What?\" I had made a bad mistake. Clearly, she was unbalanced, and somehow, I had upset her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She looked up with frenzied eyes. \"Howjado? Your daddy's an idyot says I. Thirty-seven now, but soon thirty-eight.\" She patted her stomach again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The woman needed help. I cast about. Larry rushed out the door toward us.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Did you miss your medication?\" I asked. \"Here comes my... uh, Dr. Ashley. He can help you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She glanced toward the door and grinned. Larry walked faster. Concern coated his face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Doctor?\" she hissed. \"No doctor. Body technician. Not one of us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I grew confused. Were medical workers now simply body mechanics? Had medicine progressed from a professional practice to a technical skill? Suddenly, I realized that Annie still watched me with glowing, intent eyes as if she measured my worth. I tried to calm her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Everything will be all right. Just relax. You're at a wonderful hospital, and they will give you the best of care. Larry, Dr. Ashley, is my brother. He will take good care of you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Idyot. Here not hospital. Wildlife preserve for endangered.\" She gestured towards Larry, who now closed rapidly. \"Hez alien, 'nother world. Thirty-seven humans left, soon thirty-eight.\" She patted her stomach for emphasis.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">My jaw dropped open. I stared, first at the wild-eyed Annie and then at the deep concern written across Larry's face.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Please, John, I am sorry. I didn't want you to learn this way,\" Larry said. \"We hope to have a cure for your cancer soon, but we couldn't wait.

It was just awful.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Don't you think you're overreacting?</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>You didn't have to hear yourself.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Maybe I should, then.</i>  Louis opened his mouth, attempting to say her name.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>What are you doing?</i>  Her eyes widened with horror.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A strange gurgling sound came from somewhere in his throat.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Stop it!</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ah... ahn... an,\"  he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She put her hands to her ears.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"An net!\"  he said triumphantly.  \"Annette!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She rushed down the hallway, hands still clamped over her ears, a wayward elbow knocking a framed picture off the wall.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Annette, Annette, Annette,\"  Louis called as she reached the bathroom and slammed the door shut.  He made his way after her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Come on, honey,</i>  he thought, raising his thought-voice to be heard through the door.  Then he decided he wanted to keep talking the old way.  \"It's only your name.  Annette McKalty.  I like the way it sounds, floating on the air like that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Beyond the door, the shower came on full blast.  <i>Stop it!</i>  Now the sink faucet came on.  <i>Go to work!</i> The toilet flushed.  <i>Before you're late!</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He ambled back to the kitchen.  \"Louis McKalty,\"  he said to himself.  \"Hello, my name is Louis.  And how are you today?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He straightened his tie, grabbed his briefcase and left for the office.  It was going to be a very different day.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Music played softly in the empty elevator.  Louis was fairly sure this song had once, over a century ago, contained lyrics.  He had just started to hum along with the melody--a few \"da da das\" and \"la la las\"--when the door slid open and he faced Mrs. Greenberg, standing in the lobby.  She might have heard the trailing echo of the last \"la.\"  Stepping inside, she looked around with a confused expression. The music continued to play from a speaker somewhere.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Good morning, Mrs. Greenberg.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She backed up against the wall of the elevator.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Catchy song, don't you think?\"  Louis stepped out into the empty lobby, then turned around.  \"I wish I knew the words to it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Mrs. Greenberg jabbed her finger at the button, once, twice, then again and again, until the elevator finally closed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Swinging his briefcase, he strode through the front entrance onto the sidewalk.  Not paying as much attention as he should, he brushed shoulders with a man attempting to pass him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Watch where you're--</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Pardon me,\"  Louis offered quickly.  The man cast a wary glance over his shoulder as he continued on his way.  And then another glance to make sure he wasn't being followed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Louis usually walked the five blocks to the office, but today, again, was an unusual day.  A splendid day.  A day of joyous awakening.  Stepping to the curb, he said, \"Taxi.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">No, that wouldn't do.  It had to be louder.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Tax!  Eee!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Again, not quite.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Several pedestrians stopped to stare.  Below the hum of traffic, he heard them exchanging thought-murmurs.  \"It's harder than it looks,\"  he told them, grinning.  Each of them retreated a step.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He focused for a moment, took a deep breath.  \"TAXI!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">His audience jumped as if electrocuted.  They gave him increasingly more room as he continued to shout.  Many simply fled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A cab finally pulled to the curb.  When Louis opened the back door, the driver glared at him.  <i>What are ya, some kinda nut or something?</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I don't think so.\"  He paused with the door open.  \"Should I take another cab?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Get in.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As soon as Louis put his briefcase in and closed the door, the car took off, leaving behind the gawkers.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You want to get put away, is that it?\"  the cabbie said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A day of wonderful surprises.  Louis smiled.  \"You're talking.  The old talk.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The cabbie snorted, sharing a joke with himself.  \"Everyone always thinks they're the only one.  But there are a lot of us.  A whole underground.  We know enough to keep quiet, though.  Not idiots like you, shouting at the side of the road for all to hear.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I didn't think about it.  Ever since I started having the dream, I've had the urge to talk.\"  He described his dream of drowning to the cabbie.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Always starts with a dream.  The subconscious or whatever.  In mine, I was lost in the woods, calling for help.\"  The car in front of them braked to a stop, double parking.  Swerving around it, the cab driver extended his middle finger and thought-shouted, <i>Learn to drive, ya jackass!</i>  \"Look, there's places we go to meet,\"  he said, abruptly calm again.  \"At night.  To use our voices, like the old times.  If they find out about us, it's all over.  Same with you.  Keep your mouth shut from now on and give me your contact info.  I'll be in touch, let you know when our next--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A siren blared.  In the rear view mirror, the driver's face went pale.  \"Sorry, friend.  You really shouldn't have been so clueless.\"  He pulled to the side of the road ahead of an unmarked sedan.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Seconds later, two special agents in plain clothes stood beside the cab.  They pulled Louis out and cuffed him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Good morning, gentlemen,\"  Louis said.  \"What's the trouble?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The men shook their heads in disgust.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>Thank God ya came when ya did,</i>  the cabbie thought.  <i>He wouldn't let me pull over.  Said he had a gun and was gonna make me listen to him do the old talk.  Like you heard for yourselves, it was awful.  Just awful.</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The men nodded tersely, forced Louis into the back of their cruiser and pulled into traffic.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"><i>One more off the streets,</i>  one agent remarked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Louis, hearing him, leaned forward.  \"Louis,\"  he said.  \"My name is Louis McKalty.

{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText \"><b>***Editor's Note: Adult language, adult story***</b></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I always knew that I wanted to try it at least once. It was one of those things everyone talked about like it was all spec and grand and kitsch, and I was at the GameHead with Maressa and Gen and Hole and Jex, and it all felt suddenly juvenile. Like, life was for doing things, maybe, and we were just running around this padded room chasing half wolf-people with chainsaws, and I was so completely bored of it all, you know?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We didn't go to school that day cause it was a Wednesday, and Wednesdays are optional, and the next day was the weekend, so we were just hanging around for hours. Maressa kept checking her zits in the plate she got on her arm because plates were pretty new just then, and Maressa's was massive, like, the whole sleeve. Usually people get that done a little at a time, you know, the wrist first, then up to the elbow, and etc., but Maressa went in and got the whole thing done in one sitting. And, after, everyone was knocking on the metal and talking about how grotesque it was, and I touched it once, but only because I wanted to see if it was hollow, and then I was kind of done with it, right?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anyway, the boys kept disappearing around the toilets, and I was getting left alone with Maressa while she checked her reflection and scratched holes in her cheeks, and then the boys would come back with their eyes all wide and black, and I think Hole was crashing hard on something cause he was seriously on the floor laughing his ass off about the way some little holo girl was getting her face gnawed on, and it was sick, I guess, but in this awful, average kind of way. Like, they made her squirm too much and put her in this cutesy little sundress, so you could see her legs twitch, and I just hated watching it and hated how normal it all seemed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Around the middle of the night when half the crowd was on the floor sleeping like babies, I saw Gen up at the door chatting with the skinny old hunchback who ran the booth, maybe getting another session or getting kicked out, I wasn't sure. But I liked the way he kind of held himself apart from everything, like, there was so much going on in his head that no one could ever know. And Gen and I went out sometimes, so I just grabbed his arm and pulled him outside, and the stars were doing that thing where they wink back and forth at each other, and it was all so, I don't know, kitsch, maybe?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was like, \"Let's get outta here,\" like in the old shows.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And he thought that was pretty funny, so we slipped into his car and stopped at the drug store on the corner, and then Gen drove me off into the night.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We drove for hours until we were out at the edge of Portland in that weird scattered land where it blends into Seattle. And there's a lot of stuff still, but it's all the kind of divey stuff, or the stuff that you go to when you don't want to spend so much, and you don't care that you have to walk around some dingy fluorescent showroom with static holos and fashions from, like, two months ago? And we were stopped in this no man's land cause Gen said he'd never go back to Seattle cause it was the asshole of America, or something like that, so we pulled over and took a couple Drops, and he turned the roof transparent, so we could kind of fall into the sky. We were holding hands over the console, and I was stroking where the hair on his thumb grew in long, and he let me into his RedFruit account, so we were streaming the same electro pastiche noise that always makes the air seem so foggy.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then I felt myself falling back into my seat cause I dropped my dose thirty minutes before, and it was only supposed to last something like an hour. It was, like, a very brief walk, the guy had told us. I turned my head to ask for more, but Gen's eyes were all black and inky with his pupils opened up wide, and he looked kind of beautiful, and I saw the boutique across the street with its big green bells and stars, and I'd always wanted to try it, just to see what it was like, and the world was so boring, you know?  And, anyway, everything seems sort of worth doing when you're cracked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So I said, \"What about that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And Gen turned around and pointed with his beef stick at the vid of the boy and the girl waltzing across the window, and he was like, \"Yeah?  Cause it might look good on us.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then he squeezed my hand, and that felt right, and I got out of the car, and the streets were still wet from the sweeper in that way that makes the headlights look double. And it all just seemed so right. Like, exactly how everyone said it should be.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So, we got out of the car, and then, halfway across the street, he picked me up and put me over his shoulder. I screamed, but like laughing, in that way you only do when you feel like no one else is around? That's when I thought that I really did like Gen the best of most people, and that our life was sometimes just like shows. Which is what everyone is always looking for anyway. So I felt happy, and I screamed again and kicked against his legs until he put me down, and we stood together in front of the glowing door and the dancing vid and the home printed sign that said, \"No Cards, No Cash.\" And that made everything feel so strange and old fashioned, which was just about perfect for me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Here goes.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That's what Gen said. I think he picked up that old fashioned feel, too.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Here goes,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And he winked at me with his huge black eyes, and he swung back the doors both at once, and he threw out his arm to gesture me inside, and I thought someone should, like, burst into song or something. Except Gen probably didn't even know that was how people used to do things. So I just smiled, and I waltzed inside like the girl in the window, and that's when everything started to turn around and get this very creep feeling, like, a giant rock in my stomach, and I didn't want to be there, anymore.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Almost right away I was talking myself down cause I knew that sometimes that heavy feeling just happens with Drops and inside spaces. But also, the floors were just too white, and the room was just too empty, and the girl at the big, white front desk stared too hard from beneath this spindly forest of fakes. I mean, she just had way too many glue-ons, and I thought, right then, that it was probably because she was a Rocker and had lost her last real ones from smoking her breaks away in the toilet stall. The shows had blips about that all the time.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There were these three hard plastic chairs in front of the desk. They were white, too. I guess it was supposed to be, like, a waiting room? But they were the kind of chairs you sit in when you're at the place to sell your blood. Which I didn't like because it reminded me of how they messed me up that one time and took more than they were supposed to. And I tried to tell the people in the lab jackets whenever they walked by, but they just kept checking the machines and saying it was fine, not fixing anything. And, then, when they finally took the tubes out, I stood up, and the whole room turned into these giant black spots, and I passed out so hard I cracked my skull on the table edge. When I woke up, I was laying back in the donation chair with a bag of juice next to me and some lady asking if I felt all right to drive or if they should call a hospital van. I said I felt fine, but they didn't even pay me any extra in the end, so I guess that was really a lie.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anyway, there were three of those chairs in the waiting room, and I didn't like that either. It just felt so crooked that there were three. Not two or six or twelve or any number that made sense, but three. And, for a minute, I almost couldn't take how dingy the whole thing seemed. Or, not dingy, but sterile? Phony? Like a set up. Like one of those phony sets from the new shows when the host is like, \"Look at this beautiful new apartment we gave this bum. Look at these fantastic drapes and this totally wonderful GM cooking set,\" but you can tell that all the walls are on rollers and the backstage guys are waiting to wheel the whole thing away as soon as the cameras turn off.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I pulled on Gen's sleeve for a while until he broke out of his trance, or whatever he was in, and looked down at me. Then I gave him these big quivering eyes, and I think he got how I was feeling because he lifted my chin with his hand and laid another drop under my tongue and squeezed my hand until I cooled off and got all fascinated by the way the long bare bulbs glared up at me in the floor tiles. Then I forgot for a little while that the place where we were standing was scary and not quite real.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sometime, I don't really know when, the lady with the forest eyes gave this fake little cough, like, \"hu-huhm.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I remembered we should at least tell her our names.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was still back by the door, so I kind of lurched forward and walked up like a robot. That's how it feels, sometimes. And I saw her nails for the first time. They were, like, three inches long and acid green and just clack-clacking on her pure white tablet top, waiting to call up the screen and punch in whatever our names were and whatever we wanted to get, and, for a second, the whole thing made the sick come up in my mouth, but then I swallowed it and remembered that the Drops do that sometimes, too.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Kadence Cross and Genesis Lopez,\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Except I said it all pushed together, so she couldn't understand, and I had to try two more times and finally just tap it in on the screen myself. Tap, tap, with my naked finger, all bitten down so the skin hangs ragged and gets red and infected sometimes. Tap, tap, I got our names in the screen, and they looked right, I thought, but she was still staring at me with her lips tight like a mom does? I could hear the light buzzing behind me in that flickering way, and the whole room was glaring at me again, and I was all alone because Gen got lost in some blank wall like a baby.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And that's when I started to wonder if I really wanted my first time to be with him and not, I don't know, maybe Hole or Jex? He was just so, I don't know, not there? But, like, all the time. I mean, sometimes we got cracked together, but even days that I didn't feel like flying, he'd still drop and be gone for hours while I just sat around watching the shows or sucking flavor pills because I was bored, and there was nothing else to do.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What package?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The lady blinked so hard about it that I thought she'd break her fakes. And when she asked, I shook my head a bit and knew it was really too late to turn back. You know that feeling when you think you should do something, but then you think you shouldn't, but then you feel bad because you think you, like, led someone on, or something?  Like, you shouldn't go back on your word?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So I tried to forget about Gen for a minute, and I just thought about the lady and the white door behind the desk and how exciting it felt to be like a grownup and making these big decisions.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Because getting married isn't something you should do lightly, right? It's this big, serious thing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So I kind of forgot about Gen and how he was just back there staring at the wall, and I looked through all the themes and hmmed at the different tattoos and crinkled my eyebrows together really hard while I flipped between my two top choices, like, coi? Or Greek? Because fish were really spectacle just then, and Maressa got one dripping out her ear and down her neck a few days before. But Greek was just so real. And you could write anything in it, and it just seemed so much better if you had to explain it. Besides, the letters were pretty grand.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do you think?\" I asked the lady.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was pursing my lips and feeling all adult about it because adults always make chit-chat and ask for second opinions, but she just shrugged at me and started playing the latest episode of <i>Vicious Thin</i> in the corner of her tablet top, which was a pretty awful show.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But I got distracted for a little while anyway because Craze was puking, even though his gums were all pulled back from his teeth because of stomach acid or something? And his best friend Freeze said she'd kill herself if she ever caught him doing it ever again, and it was hard not to get caught up in the drama.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then a blip came up for flavor pills, and I kind of blinked away from the screen and pointed to the fish cause they were the first thing I saw, and I thought they'd look nice floating around our wrists, and, plus, I didn't know what I would want to say in Greek anyway.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I shook Gen until he looked away from the wall, and the lady shot our order back with one of her acid green fingertips. Then the white door opened in the shiny white wall, and we walked into the back room with this greased, skeezy old punker who hadn't changed his clothes since, like, the 20's, and after that the rest was all just weird and clinical.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We sat in black plastic chairs in a tiny tile room, and the longest part ended up being the tattoo, even though I hear it used to take a lot longer before they had the stamps. Then the admin sliced under the nails of our fourth fingers and slid these little chips into the skin. It hurt a lot, and I didn't like looking at the blood that kind of welled up in a bubble. And that was that.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Now, everywhere we went, the scanners would read our fingers and know that we were legal. Gen would get blips about my favorite food and my dream vacation spot and which new pants I tagged for my wish list next Christmas. We'd get updates on each other's diets and heart rates and cholesterol levels and GPS coordinates so we could always find each other, I guess.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It's romantic, isn't it?\" I asked the skeezer before we left, but he didn't answer</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then Gen was staring at the door and all like, \"Come on.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He was still holding that beef stick and pointing around with it, this time to the exit that opened out back and into the alleyway. I followed him, and the door clicked shut behind us, and there were a couple of trash bins and a roll of toilet paper that someone had</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">pushed, so it made a trail into the street.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Genesis pulled out the dropper again, and I looked up into his black eyes and hollow cheeks and made myself think, <i>We're married. Isn't it just so real?  This is so grand and real and romantic,</i> over and over again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What a show, right?\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">His eyes kind of opened a little wider, and he grabbed my hand in his. But my finger was still sore, so I pulled away from him because he wasn't paying too much attention, and he squeezed it a little too hard. Then he was walking down the alley back toward his car.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What a fucking show. Let's go to the party, so people can see.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I remembered that there was a party at Maressa's, and I thought that I used to want her to see how the fish curled around the bones of my wrist, but somehow that didn't feel right anymore. Like, maybe fish weren't the right choice. Maybe they weren't as spec as I thought they would be.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Come on,\" he was yelling cause he was already at the car.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But I was falling pretty hard just then, and the yelling grated in my head, I hated him a little bit anyway, I think, because I was already tired of his face and that stupid beef stick and his shiny black eyes that were always staring out at nothing. And I'd never liked the way he drove or kept himself apart from everything, like a kid trying to get everyone's attention.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Kadence, so, let's go,\" he said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I thought, <i>Who is this guy?</i></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So I said, \"It's not a fucking show, right? We're married. What</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">does that mean to you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And he was like, \"Are you crazy? Do you need another drop or what?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I said, \"What does it mean to you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And he was like, \"Crash, real, why am I even listening to this?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I said, \"I can go back inside right now and pull this shit out of my finger, if that's what you want.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And he was like, \"I. Want. To. Go. To. The. Party.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">All slow, like I was slow. So I turned around to storm back inside cause I thought that might make him sorry and change his mind, but, when I got to the door, there was no handle, just the smooth metal surface and the brick wall. I started clawing at it anyway, you know, for effect. I really wanted him to know how much I wanted to get back inside. Then maybe he would get it, and I wouldn't have to hate everything so much.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I was screaming, \"You're such a fucking juvenile. You're just a fucking child.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Anyway, I gave up after a minute and turned around, and I was shaking, and my stomach was dropping, and I could feel myself making my face all tragic for him, but I still really felt it too, you know? Like, we were supposed to do something, and this was a big night, but it all ended up so fake and boring like the girl in the sundress. Which I guess made Gen just another Hole, laying around, laughing, so gone he never noticed how everything is exactly the same as everything else.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I think I might have been crying, and I let myself do it, but it wasn't a show either, you know? I really meant it, but it didn't matter either way cause Gen was gone.  I thought for a minute whether this was just jitters or whether it was really over, but then I knew that I didn't have to wonder. I already knew the answer, and, even with as big as everyone said it should be? even this wouldn't matter tomorrow.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After that I stood alone for a while in the dead zone, and I kind of wished it could go on forever. If it could just go on, I thought, and I could go back into the olden times where things were less ordinary and something more like what's true then, I don't know, I think I had some answer then for what would happen that night, but I don't remember it now.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">That was when I started walking down this empty road, and it was wet so the lights were doubled, and I walked past the big green bells and the buzzing streams, and I walked even further. I walked out and further, and I think I was waiting for someone to come from behind the scenes and push back all these rolling walls that kept pressing in at me and flashing their window displays. If I could just find a way to roll them back, I thought, I could get the rock out of my stomach, and maybe I would understand why it was more real to cry when I'm alone and why everything I know is sometimes nothing.  And why the whole world seems the least awful if I can just stare up and up and fall into the far off winking stars.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/jane-elliott/grand-kitsch", "title": null},
{"body": ["<div class=\"storyText storyText_initialCap\">Every night before I hit the bars, I push the mattress off my bed and pick out one of the expensive watches.  In my house, under the mattress is the safest hiding spot.  I select a watch, like I do every Friday night, and put it on.  Real leather wallets keep the watches company; I choose one of those and shove money inside.  Without the mattress, my bed looks like a snake-lover's garden: silvery serpentine watches crawl over brown rock-like wallets.  I replace the mattress.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Every time I head out, I think: <i>Luna City is beautiful at night.</i> It's the same every night, but it's beautiful.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Daytime is a recurring nightmare filled with unceasing sameness.  I get up at the same time each day and take my shower at the exact same time because the water supply is tightly controlled.  I wait for a crowded floater to stop in front of my dome and for the driver to throw open the dome's latch.  I get on the floater and stand between the same sweaty people and I never get a seat and I get off at the dome stop linked up to my work complex.  The floater keeps going, bumping along on a jet of pushed air, a giant farting machine.  As precise as clockwork, the floater comes around at the same time each day, and farts along at the same speed, traveling every day along the same dome-dotted path.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">At work, every day is the exact same.  I work with the same people, and take my breaks in the same cafeteria.  I come in to work every day at the same time and I eat lunch at the same time and the boss yells, every day at the same time.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But nighttime is a different story.  Nighttime, the domelights are dimmed and pretty girls go out to the bars.  They all wear tight pants and yellow eye shadow and dark green lipstick.  The same, but beautiful.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When I leave my apartment at night, I never take the floater.  I walk in the underground tunnels connecting the domes.  I walk in the tunnels, taking my time and looking at the people that pass by, and when I feel I've walked enough, I take the nearest elevator into whichever dome I've reached.  I'm not worried about finding my way around--the domes all have the same design and each has a bar or two or three.  This one has three.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The streets are narrow--there are no cars on the moon, and floaters travel the undeveloped spaces between domes.  Everyone walks everywhere inside a dome, and everyone is walking everywhere now.  The dome is packed, people pouring through the narrow streets like angry water racing down the twists and turns of a badly designed river.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Each building, dome-topped like the larger dome above it, announces its existence with an arching sign that follows the curve of its roof.  At night, those buildings still open for business--restaurants and bars and movie theatres mostly--turn on their neon to outline the letters of their signs in bright green or pink or orange.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I go into the nearest bar.  It's packed, like the streets.  The bars all play the same music, and they play it over and over again.  DJs don't decide what to play, but when to play it and how often.  The songs themselves are all the same, and it's sometimes hard to know when one song has finished and another has begun.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I see a girl, then walk up to her and offer to buy her a drink.  She says yes.  I pull out my wallet, but can't tell if her gaze drifts over the money inside.  As I'm paying the waiter, I think I see her gaze drift over my silver watch.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Later, she says yes, she will come home with me.  We walk in the tunnels but don't talk at all.  I unlock my door to let her in, like I've done for a hundred girls on a hundred different nights.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We are inside my room and I leave the lights off, like every other time.  I come up behind her, wrapping my arms around her waist.  I begin to undress her.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She turns around, allowing her clothes to fall to the floor.  She begins to undress me.  I bend my head; we kiss.  We are in bed; we're making love.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It is the same, but it is beautiful. Like Luna City at night.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I turn over and pretend to sleep.  I am content although I know what will happen, what has happened a hundred times before. The girl I've brought home will pretend to sleep too; a short while later, she will get up.  Being very quiet, she will slip my watch off the nightstand, then ruffle through my clothes, looking for my wallet.  If I'm still awake, I'll hear the door open, then I'll hear it close.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I sleep.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In the morning, I stretch my arms but bump against something hard.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ow,\" she says, rubbing her head.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're still here,\" I say.  Without meaning to, my gaze drifts over to the nightstand.  My watch is there, my clothes undisturbed.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She gives me a quizzical look.  \"Did you expect me to leave in the middle of the night?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Luna City is beautiful at night,\" I blurt out, not sure what I'm saying.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She rises from the bed and goes to the window, pulls back the curtain to let the light in.  \"I think it's gorgeous in daytime.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I rise and come up behind her, wrapping my arms around her again, the same as the night before but somehow entirely different, and I look out over my little dome, bathed in a dawnish light, and at the domes I can see past my own, glowing with their own dawnish light.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes,\" I say.  \"I never really noticed.\"</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/karl-el-koura/luna-city-at-night", "title": null},

Our genetics were not perfect. Such imperfections were expected: they were neither a cause for dismay, nor for greater efforts. He was the decimal point we had rounded off long ago. Thirty years ago, my predecessor had encountered much resistance to his proclamation that the era of genetic strengthening was over. The thousands of years, the trillions of dollars, the lives destroyed and redirected, in order to reach this point, and now he wanted to stop?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But the cost/benefit analysis was clear. No matter how satisfying it would be to fully eliminate those pernicious genes, their presence was unlikely to cause enough sadness to outweigh the cost of eliminating them.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">So I knew he would come into existence. And I knew that, somehow, he would come to our attention.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There's nothing wrong with him,\" I said, when his parents came to our institute all-unknowing, dragging him sullen, quiet, through the doors.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But his tests,\" they said. \"He's underperforming.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I looked at the two of them and tried to perceive the strains of melancholy with which they'd impregnated their child. Did his father stare too long at the walls, thinking the same thoughts again and again? Did his mother stay late at her work, not knowing she was trying to muster the energy to come home? But no, the recessive poison was too well-veiled to manifest in them. They were over thirty years old. If the program had taken notice of them, suggestions would have been embedded. It would simply never have occurred to these two to reproduce.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was curious about the boy. There will be too many of him, infinitely many, over the coming millions of years. Only a few thousand years ago, the world was bursting with him. And our descendents won't have even our limited resistance to his type. Would he twitch and wriggle along our social-semantic networks? Would his city depopulate, its people driven out of their homes by the seemingly sourceless gloom that spread outwards from him?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I felt that gloom, even after just a few minutes in the same room with him. It felt as if the sunlight streaming through the windows catching the swirling motes of dust was not so bright. In his slumped shoulders all I could see was the sun setting and the ending of another ceaseless day. I pitied his parents. He'd brought a hell to their home that they were not born for.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"There is nothing wrong with him,\" I said. \"Our testing has revealed certain rare genetic tendencies. But they were once quite common. And those who had them were well able to lead nations, compose symphonies, and reach high levels of achievement in all the fields of human endeavor.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But he doesn't talk,\" his mother said. \"He won't get out of bed in the mornings. He's not acting right.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What do you think?\" I said to the child.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I feel fine,\" he said. \"I don't know what everyone is so worried about. Can't we go home now?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I was charmed. Fine, just fine.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But maybe, isn't he\u2026 depressed?\" his mother said. She had whispered the last, dreaded word. Her husband backed away a step, withdrawing from our circle of consultation. She continued. \"I heard there is a factory. I heard it still makes the medicines.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Not depressed,\" I said. \"Simply\u2026 less joyful. He sees life differently. It's all very normal. Every human being has a genetically-determined baseline emotional level that remains relatively constant throughout their life. It is only very loosely correlated with achievement. On average, rich people are no happier than poor people. Successful people are no happier than failures. Your son just falls on one end of the curve.\" A curve we'd spent millennia compressing...</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When he left, I leaned back in my office chair, put my feet up on my desk, and cancelled the rest of my appointments. Could I make him happy? Was there a drug? Or a gene-therapy? Or should I? And for long moments, I wondered what he would bring to us. For the first time, someone like him would be\u2026 uncontrolled. Would he rise up and write his name across the sky? Would he bring back technological progress? Would he bring back war and conquest? Would he smash our paradise? Did we want him to? Would we--would I--rather be excited than happy?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then, long after night had fallen, I smiled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The record of a single day in the life of a single human being represents an immense amount of data: Passing records in video-monitors, phone conversations, biometric sensors, browsing histories, keystroke recorders\u2026 all multiplied by an entire circle of acquaintances, friends, and relatives.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Once, there was an entire industry devoted to analyzing this data. We'd had computers, heuristics, specialized programs, datasets, algorithms, and millions of people working out of thousands of centers. Over time, we'd devoted more and more resources to watching, and redirecting, smaller and smaller numbers of \"risky\" individuals. And then we did our job too well, and there were no more risks.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Now there was just my institute, and three others like it, to ensure that four billion souls didn't stray from the thought patterns we'd laid down for them. For the last decade, we'd largely been trying to squeeze a few more percentage points of wellbeing out of the age-old patterns. We carefully measured the influence of notions currently in vogue, and developed vectors to alter the range and meaning of words, phrases, ideas, myths, types of relationships, types of careers, morals, ethics, life-patterns, and all the other mental structures used to categorize the raw inputs of life.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We'd limited our range of vectors to the mass media: movies, television, email, graffiti, conversations on the street, carefully crafted virtual personas, technical manuals, comic strips, the color paragraphs of news stories, and hundreds of other seemingly sourceless bits of semantically-freighted noise. And that was more than enough, as long as there were no other sources of original thought, or any conflicts that could cause such thought to spontaneously arise.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But I refocused our energies. Those patterns were good enough. Our people were happy enough. For the first time in a century, we had a possible spoiling factor in our midst. He had to be watched.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Though we would not actively interfere in his life, we expected him to be destroyed. In preparation for this day, we had spent generations instilling a loathing for anti-social behaviors into the population. They would drive him out and ostracize him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">In those screens, I watched a young man, a classmate, draw into our subject's orbit and be disordered by the enchantments of melancholy. I watched them sit on a stoop together and, under the influence of so many grave and serious evenings with the sad child, laughter was erased from the friend's face and then from his mind, and replaced with a kind of ecstatic transportation that feels like nothing at the time, that is just the aether for birthing and devouring strange emotions, but in remembrance will be indistinguishable from joy. The sad child infected his classmate with the brooding ruminations, the twists and turns and wearings-down of the machinery of the mind, the endless, exhausting reflection that, in small amounts, mimics the symptoms of love.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And I watched the friend bounce out of our subject's orbit, ejected back into the world\u2026 save for the occasional glance backwards to see that yes there had been an effect, that our subject couldn't look at his once-comrade, that he had taken to bed, that he was not going to recover\u2026 a glance that ended, self-satisfied, far before mine, else it would have seen our subject take to the world again and again and charm one and another with the dim, flickering light of his attention.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And the sad young man wrote: \"What does it feel like to be like them? Can't they see how absurd this is? How this life is barely worth living when even the best of times are only a few inches above the threshold of total despair?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And my researchers wrote: \"What is it like to be him?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I had dreams that our subject would carry on the traditions of Camus, Sartre, Dostoyevsky, of that last great generation before the plan, before the institutes, had rendered those traditions moot.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Scribbling in notebooks, he wrote poetry, and we ran every line through semantic analysis. We tore the words apart and put them back together, knotting them around our minds and into our dreams until his thoughts became the vocabulary we used to describe ourselves.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He wrote: \"That doctor said I wasn't like them. But there has to be a reason that people like me existed. Maybe we just saw more clearly. That long line of us looked into the world and saw what was there and communicated things that people didn't know they wanted to hear.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Then the words began showing up elsewhere. Miles away. Scrawled on walls and desks. Or in chance conversations. And, excited, we tracked them back. His city was the epicenter.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Hadn't I always secretly dreamed that he would tear us apart? That he would derail this stable endpoint of human history, this happy horrible ditch I'd dug deeper and deeper for my entire professional life? Had I always secretly hated it?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And our genius didn't notice. He grew into maturity, misunderstood but not disliked. His modes of being solidified: taking weeks to return a call where one of us would return it immediately; lapsing into silences in social situations; being late for his obligations; refusing responsibilities; forgetting names, faces, friends, forgetting all solid things once they were out of his sight.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He wrote: \"I don't want to make them unhappy. They just need to see. They need to understand. They'll be better off that way. I live with them; I can make them see how irrational they're being.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Depressive realism is what primitive memetic engineers used to call it. It was the tendency of clinically-depressed patients to more accurately assess the (low) probability of fortunate events. Happiness was irrational. How could anything but irrationality explain the decision to buy a lottery ticket, start a business, or get married, when you had a 99.99999%, 90%, or 50% chance of failure?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">One of my lead researchers brought me a set of regressions from the latest round of annual reports. Population growth and economic activity in his city had shot upwards. And the effects were tightly clustered around where he lived. The economic benefits were directly proportional to how much time he spent in a neighborhood. Stores where he shopped experienced a surge in profits. Authors he read climbed to the top of the sales charts. There was no doubt that his presence, his interest, was the strongest link between these otherwise inexplicable effects.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What possible mechanism could there be for this?\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"For the last three months, my team has been discussing a possibility,\" the researcher said. \"It has to be semantic contagion. Why did it take our intervention to wipe out these genetic tendencies? Why did they not die out naturally? They are prone to suicide, drug abuse, over-eating, and unhealthy living. On average, their productivity is low. How did they survive? What advantage did these genes confer? One explanation has always been that of some mental power\u2026 some power of compulsion that is inherent in their twisted memeplexes. They attract healthy, productive, people to them, and find ways to live off the mounting excess.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But this isn't destructive,\" I said. \"Have indicators of well-being dropped? Have indicators of consumption dropped across the system? Where are these dollars, these people coming from? What's the effect on the system as a whole?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Neutral,\" the researcher said. \"And hence unproductive. He's merely shifting resources from elsewhere.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But if overall wellbeing isn't\u2026\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You have to neutralize him,\" the researcher said. \"The organizational directives were never repealed. The necessary procedures still exist. There is even a team that still operates intermittently, when needed, out of the East Asia Pacific region.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're joking.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The plan is ours, now. And we act not for today, or for one life, but for eternity. We've monitored this irregularity for long enough.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I laughed him out of my office. What would the world come to, if I had to rely on colleagues like that to protect the plan?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sometimes it seemed like the growing excitement had even managed to infect the subject. Of course, he wasn't immune to joy. He just felt joy less keenly than the plan, long ago, had deemed desirable.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And his social-semantic networks, tenuous as they were, couldn't help but respond to the increased froth of the life just beyond his doorstep.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He'd aged into early adulthood and left home. An uncommon move. We preferred that adults stay close to their childhood social networks. This allowed for finer gradations of control and less semantic pollution between project areas.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">People agglomerated to him. And this drifting cast began to fill the computer screens of our Institute, as the aggregation effort expanded and expanded to catch every glimpse, every conversation, every concretized thought involving him. The young men and women formed themselves into the furniture of his life. They sat on his couch, and drifted through the rooms of his apartment. They lived with him and fell in love with him, and talked about him, and some of them, so far as we could see, even managed to pierce his thoughts and become important to him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">At international conferences, my staff must have gossipped about our findings. During the biannual meeting of the directors of the four institutes, my colleagues gathered to question me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But what is the mechanism for this supposed effect?\" the Beijing director said. He was the oldest of us, and I'd known him for my entire life. When I was a child, he spoke to me for half of an hour and then recommended that I be put on the director track. I'd never asked him why he'd chosen me, but I still wondered what the criteria had been.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It doesn't matter,\" replied the Kinshasa director. He had only recently taken up his post. \"This youth should not exist. My predecessor argued, thirty years ago, that we should carry the plan to its logical conclusion, and eliminate all possibility of such unpredictable elements ever arising.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But don't you wonder?\" I said. \"What kind of creature did we eliminate? Why is he so powerful?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What are you saying?\" said Brussels. The emissary from that barren, depopulated region rarely spoke. He rarely needed to. They'd shown us the way, long ago.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"He should not be having this impact,\" Beijing said. \"He is not some magical creature. It is ludicrous to grant some incantatory power to low emotional well-being.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Abraham Lincoln,\" I said. \"Woolf, Byron, Blake, Dostoyevsky, Eliot, Lorca, Plath--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Have shown no surge in popularity as our program increased its efficacy. Rather the opposite, in fact. We've studied this. You've studied this. What is the mechanism for this young man's power?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Eliminate him,\" Brussels said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But what if we've eliminated some powerful aspect of the human spirit?\" I said. \"Something that all of us, everywhere, all of our 'happy' populations, secretly long for, and respond to, and love? How can we not study that?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And what if we did?\" Kinshasa said. \"People like your young man posed no Darwinian cost, or nature would have done our work for us. We always knew that. But we made a choice. And that choice was magnificent.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Your reasoning is faulty,\" Beijing said. \"This young man is neither dangerous nor worthy of study. If our plan was that weak, it would have collapsed long ago. Let him be.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Our arguments went round and round, deadlocking again and again. We preferred to come to decisions by consensus, but we eventually had to resort to the weak expedient of voting. Our final vote was 2-2, and as the most senior, Beijing decided the tie in my favor. More to the point, he possessed the only functioning assassination team, though Kinshasa hinted that he would not be above a unilateral cross-regional solution.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">As we parted, Beijing took my hand. I could not recall the last time we had touched. Physical contact was uncharacteristic for him. He said, \"You are the object of my only remaining personal bond. And sometimes I feel that even a single friend may be too many for someone in my position. The only dangerous component of this situation is the way you've become obsessed by this boy.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I froze in place, and he kept my hand. He glanced down, and then stared into my eyes for several seconds. His warning took hold. Releasing me, he said, \"Take care.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When I returned to my institute, I ran the regressions in private, looking for where the boy's words had first shown up. Florida--during the period of the Everglades Wellness Project. Arizona--during the Cross-Border Harmonization Initiative. New York City, right after the yearly semantic remapping.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was no magic. The boy was no genius. His words did not stick in minds and ride the highways and show up in distant cities and pull people towards him. We were the vector. We were the mechanism.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I'd devoted thousands of weeks of staff-time to watching this boy. I'd buried him in the minds of my staff. And he'd flown up and out and into the world during their other activities. Unconsciously, they snuck little bits and pieces of the boy's world--his city, his neighborhood, his stores, the habits of his friends--into their work. A tiny, harmless tilt, similar to that which occurred naturally all the time. But normally the personal range of preferences, carefully randomized amongst the staff, canceled out and devolved into noise. I'd harmonized them. I'd slammed the boy into their mental landscape. I'd endangered the plan.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy had written: \"Sometimes I can feel the currents of the world changing around me. I can feel myself being injected into them, forcing them to see. I don't know precisely what is happening, but I know that somehow we're all working together, we're all going to slide out of this rut, and we're going to step into the future and finally manage to build something new.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Meanwhile, I swapped personnel with the other institutes. I sent the staff who'd been most involved in monitoring the boy on long-term assignments in the field, and rotated field staff back to headquarters. I gave a low priority to publications on the boy. I slowly altered the semantic networks of the Institute itself--I whispered into the computers that this phenomenon was an idiosyncrasy, that I was an old fool, and that watching one youth was a waste of time--and, in response, the effect he was having also cooled.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And then the day came when my paper was ready. It detailed the problem my passion had caused, the steps I'd taken, and recommended the institution of social-semantic interventions to prevent it. We'd long known that the only true danger to the plan was ourselves. But we'd finally reached the long-prophesied point where our control was so absolute that even our unconscious whims were a greater danger than any thoughts those four billion tamed minds could generate.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">After I transmitted my paper, I received a call from Beijing. He said, \"You've repaid my trust in you. You will go down in history for this. Well\u2026 our history.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I hope he never knew how close I'd come to not publishing that paper. How I'd delayed in even writing it. How, in the end, the habits of mind--the habits he'd beaten into me--had won.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">But perhaps he did know. Four meetings later he came to me and said, \"Your health is not good. Perhaps it is time for the system to take you?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">We all joked about the day we'd surrender ourselves to the plan and go out and live in the world. But it was not a joke. There was a system in place for each of us, created and continuously remapped from the very first day we entered the institutes.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I haven't begun to look for a successor,\" I said, not bothering to protest that Beijing was in far worse health than me.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We never expected that you would,\" he said. \"You are the last Washington director. You have demonstrated our superfluity. We will become three. And, when I die, two.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And someday none?\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Someday,\" Beijing said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"And who has been in charge of developing my retirement plan?\" I said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Me,\" he said. \"It's always been me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So then tell me,\" I said. \"Tell me what I do now?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Beijing smiled and said, \"Whatever you want. You know that.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \" align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/squiggly-dealie.gif\"></div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I moved to the city of the boy. Except that he is now a man, and not young. And now I watch him through a window instead of a screen. Without my unconscious interference, the thought patterns we'd embedded in the population had done their work.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He is now alone. Does he wonder where everyone went? Does he wonder why this world has begun to ignore him? Does he wonder why he has been progressively forced to its fringes, and rendered invisible?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I see him walking down the street, hunched-over and broken. Was there really nothing there? Was that fascination just a mirage? Do I want it to be? Am I happy?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And as he walks by, I whisper, \"Do something. Do something.\" And I don't know whether I'm talking to him or to myself.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/rahul-kanakia/we-planted-the-sad-child-and-watched", "title": null},

Abashed, she tries again.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It was, uh. It was, uh, it was...,\" she says, stuttering uselessly. She doesn't know how to say the words. She doesn't know how to say something without the universal hyperbole of electronic dialect. She's like a heroin addict trying a cup of coffee for the first time in ages. What <i>is</i> this?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You're doing great,\" I say again. \"Take your time, and think of the right word.

It was a pretty good... episode?,\" she says at last. I nod, and she breaks out into a wide grin.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It was pretty good.

Usually,\" I say, breaking through the Art to talk about it, \"usually when you bring up a topic you speak back and forth about it for a little while to explore it.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"LMGTFY,\" she says, retreating to snark.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">I pursue her with sanctimoniousness. \"Acronyms are for texting.

Subjects and verbs mostly reach a grammatical detente, syntax is only marginally butchered. I catch the parents looking in through the window. He's dressed in velvet tails and a quizzing glass. She's got enough taffeta to hit silk quota for the whole quadrant; thousands of dollars of fabric there. I used to work in zero-G sericulture, actually, back on the <i>Mustafa Kemal</i>.

For teaching their daughter a Lost Art.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The chess clock chimes, and her phone lights back up.

It hasn't occurred to anyone else to ask about my art. \"It's an installation piece,\" I tell her. \"Mixed media. That means, like, not just paint. It's kind of a mosaic. I painted this face, but in sections like a grid. So it's about eighty different pieces of face all put together. And then over some of the sections I put this frosted glass so you can only just barely see through it, and over some of the sections I put little square mirrors. They're going to mount it at eye level and have a line where you stand so your reflection matches up with the portrait. Well, as close as possible. I'd want to adjust it for everyone, but there's no time... The idea is to make the painting act like a real person. Everyone sees it differently because they're seeing part of themselves at the same time. I wanted to give it a shimmer. Not with glitter or holographs. As real as possible.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">By the time I finish I feel like I'm making excuses for it, making apologies.

Check her eyes for pigmentation mutations.  Does one little boy seem to bend oddly when he reaches for the chips?  A friendly parental hand on his spine will let you know if he's been modified for flexibility.  Do those sisters who always come over to play together always seem to know what the other one is thinking before they say it?  It may not be just a close family at work, but a dangerous mutation!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">3.  Serve strawberries.  Five out of the nine most common mutations are correlated with a strawberry allergy.  Sure, your daughter's best chum could have just gotten unlucky--but do you want her to be friends with that kind of freak anyway?  A responsible parent corrects for ordinary allergies anyway!  Better safe than sorry!  Shortcakes all around!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">4.  A day at the beach.  Bathing suits will display some of the most egregious mutations available on the market, and frolicking in the water will show even more of them.  Webbing and gills may sound like a good idea to the na\u00efve parent, but they take a child squarely outside the mainstream of human modification.  An outing to a nearby ocean or large lake should let you know for sure.  (Note: in some regions of Scotland, SelkieModTM is registered as a normal local variant.  This is one of their quaint ethnic customs and should not be looked down on by those of us from less tribal localities, hard though it may be to overlook such a shocking breach of good taste.)</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">5.  Hostility to your child's normal modifications.  Naturally everyone who can afford it will be modified for speed, strength, and flexibility within normal ranges.  After all, what's money for?  If your child has a classmate who seems frustrated or upset that you have provided them these advantages, it may be that this child's parents squandered their money on more foolish genetic choices.  Don't take religion for an answer!  All the mainstream religious leaders are safely modified these days.  Anyone who's hostile to your child's normal modifications has something to hide.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">6.  Nature made cuteness for a reason.  Ever wonder why scorpions and poisonous spiders are so hideous and scary to normal people?  It's because they're dangerous!  In the days before modifications, it was difficult to get people to work as entomologists, because normal people simply don't want to.  Well, nature has not betrayed us.  Is one of your child's friends lumpy, weird-nosed, or just plain funny-looking?  That's the one to keep an eye on!  Normal people modify their children to be cute.  It's the human preference.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">7.  Special connections with plants or animals.  In the original human genetic code, we were separate from the rest of the plant and animal kingdoms, as nature intended.  If Fido seems to follow and adore your child's new friend--or snarl at him with raised hackles--that's a sign something is not as it should be. Fewer mutants are so blatant as to affect plants in a way that you can observe, but look at the ferns after little Bobby leaves!  Are they perky and greener?  A wary parent is a safe parent!</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">8.  Watch for overcompensation.  Everyone knows the old \"throw a vase at your child's friend's head to see if she uses her super-fast reflexes to catch it\" trick--even the parents of mutants.  That \"clumsy\" girl may have let you give her that black eye just to throw you off the trail and put you on the defensive.  Don't let her get away with it!  Other adults may be brainwashed to think of you as the bad guy in this situation, but you know that you are merely a vigilant and concerned parent.  Your conscience is clear.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Remember, you are your child's first and last line of defense against the bad influence of overmodified playmates!  If you suspect a dangerous mutation, report it to your local parent group or to the government's new Mod-Stopper Branch.</div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/marissa-kristine-lingen/modification-or-mutation-8-ways-a-parent-can-be-sure", "title": null},

But the thing is, nobody does anymore.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Three years ago, the world died. There was no warning. No one submitted a memo. One morning, everyone woke up and nobody was scared. Nobody was angry or hurt or happy or sad. Nobody felt anything but cold logic.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">And the world is better off. The population has stopped growing out of control; hunger and crime have been all but eliminated.

From your movies, it appears that all the good emotions--humor, happiness, pleasure, joy--all arise from interactions with others, so it is possible that if you interact with another human being in a manner other than the logical fulfillment of your everyday tasks, this will be enough to elicit an emotion.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You stand on the street outside your apartment and look for likely candidates, but everyone appears the same, their faces set in the same expression of concentration, eyes forward and unwavering.

His lips are set in a line. He moves like he has somewhere to go, but does not rush. There is no urgency in him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">You step up to the boy, imitate the smile you have seen in your old movies, though you do not feel the emotion this expression is supposed to convey. You say, \"What kind of dinosaur has the biggest vocabulary?\" Pause. \"A Thesaurus!\" Your delivery of the joke is flawless, but you feel nothing. You wait for a reaction from the boy, but there is nothing. He steps past you and continues on his way.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Your experiment is a failure. But, you remember, negative emotions were always stronger than positive ones, so perhaps you are going about this the wrong way. You quickly revise your experiment, then turn after the boy, walking just fast enough to catch him. You grab his shoulders, pause for a second, and push.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The boy, not expecting your assault, falls. He doesn't move his arms to catch himself, and his head strikes a fire hydrant.

You have been without emotions for so long that it is hard to identify them now that you have finally managed to elicit one. Anger?

Another lingers longer--remorse, you think--but then this, too, fades.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Standing over the boy, you stare down at his body; you think he is still breathing.

It was exactly what he needed, rich and sweet with notes of cherry syrup, the carbonation prickling his throat as he swallowed. A small bowl of salted nuts appeared on the dispenser plate and he helped himself. \"AIs are forbidden from allowing humans to come to harm.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ashley didn't seem to hear. \"After a while we didn't even bother taking cover. Masa was standing on a pile of bots ten feet high--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Of course she was.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ashley made a sour face. \"Are you still on about Masako? She's a comrade in arms, nothing more.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sure.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Anyway, the whole thing was a farce. The bots just let us destroy them until we got bored, then agreed to our demands. We can set up a human-run government, draft our own laws, even start an economy, just as long as we guarantee equal rights and protection to all citizens, provide for health care and social welfare, and don't force anyone to join who doesn't want to.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That sounds pretty reasonable.\" Rob noticed that RL-147 was surreptitiously cleaning the kitchen, and moved to the living room to distract Ashley.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's not the point,\" she said, still leaning on the counter. \"It's about freedom.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We <i>are</i> free.\" Rob's beer suddenly didn't taste so good. He set it down on the table, then watched it sink into the faux-wood. \"I can go anywhere I want, do anything I want, just so long as it doesn't infringe on someone else's rights.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But the AIs run everything!\" Ashley crumpled up her can and thrust it back into her knapsack.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"So? They're a lot better at it than we are. Haven't you seen the twidvids of what it was like before the Singularity--war, famine, disease, the unequal distribution of resources? Now, everyone has exactly what they need. How can you complain? The AIs are giving you a government. I mean, they staged a damn war to make you happy!\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But it wasn't real.\" Ashley was on her feet, hands clenched into fists.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Whistler whined, looking back and forth between them, deaf to words but wise to tone. Rob knelt to stroke his head. \"Do you want to go outside? Play with your toys? C'mon, let's go outside.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why do you always do this? Talk to me, Rob. Don't hide behind the dog.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He walked over to the door, Ashley's gaze bonfire hot on his retreating back. Whistler glanced over his shoulder as the door flicked open.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Go on.\" Rob forced excitement into his voice, and Whistler reluctantly trotted out into the yard. The door shut, then went transparent so that Rob could watch the dog play.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">When he turned back, Ashley was pointing her rifle at him.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Sweat prickled Rob's back, but only for a moment before the smart fabric of his shirt wicked it away. He knew that Ashley wouldn't hurt him, couldn't hurt him. Even if she fired, RL-147 would stop her. And yet, some deep part of his brain still recognized the primal threat in her stance. His vision sharpened, everything fading into the background but Ashley and her rifle. He could see the smudge of soot on her cheek, the scorch marks on her vest where the bots' lasers had come within a carefully measured hairsbreadth of flesh, the long, matte-plastic barrel of her omnirifle pointed at his chest. It struck him as a desperate, almost romantic image, until she pulled the trigger.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Nothing happened.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ashley flung the rifle aside. \"See, it won't fire if there's even a chance of hitting someone. I built my gun from scratch, just like everyone else in the resistance cell, but somehow the AIs altered it. I don't know if it was the parts we used, or if they did something to the rifles afterward. I can't even hurt someone accidentally.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's not necessarily bad.\" Rob's knees felt a little shaky. He collapsed into a chair that rose up from the floor. His beer was back, no--not beer, the glass was smaller and there were ice cubes in it. Bourbon then, or maybe scotch.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Nothing we do matters.\" The house disgorged another chair, but Ashley kicked it over. \"We don't matter.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Rob didn't reply. There was no point talking to her when she got like this. He took a drink. Definitely scotch.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Somewhere outside, Whistler barked at the ro-bunny Rob had brought home a few weeks ago. He'd decided it was cruel to let the dog chase real rabbits, and besides, Whistler didn't seem to know the difference.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"All I want is a chance.\" Ashley sunk to the floor, blinking back angry tears.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"What's stopping you?\" Rob said, a little more harshly than he'd intended. The alcohol was going to his head, but he didn't want to stop drinking. He set the empty glass down and another one appeared. \"Didn't you say they made you president?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yeah. We had everything figured out. Wang and Djaulot made a list of legal codes from over seventy pre-Singularity nation states. Masa and I were--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Masa.\" Rob rolled the name around his mouth like piece of sour candy. He finished off the scotch, crunching on the ice the way Ashley hated. It took a few moments for another glass to appear.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"That's not whiskey, you know,\" she said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I know, it's scotch.\" Rob's lips and nose were starting to buzz.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, it's not scotch. I mean, it doesn't even look like scotch.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Sure it does.\" Rob swirled the bright yellow liquid in his glass.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Also, the AIs are manipulating the proof to keep you from getting too drunk. Alcohol is poison, remember.\" She withdrew a heavy glass bottle from her sack. Its label had long since worn away, and the liquid within was the color of dry, dead leaves. \"<i>This</i> is scotch.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">She offered it to him, but Rob only tipped his new glass back with a contrary toss of his head, then did the same with the next for good measure.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">He felt sorry for Ashley, he really did. Humanity's self-determinism craze had long ago given way to an obsession with pre-Singularity extreme sports. But, as with all fads, a few stalwarts hung on, too stubborn or nostalgic to tread the rising tide of social progress. Rob saw them every day, pedaling their velocipedes along the zip tubes, raising re-genn'd passenger pigeons and dodo birds in rooftop menageries. Some people just couldn't let go.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Thin bars of light slipped through the autoblinds, casting Ashley's face in tiger stripes of gold and grey. Her smell, oil and sweat, was suddenly sharp in Rob's nose, cutting through the neutral floral-spice odor of the kitchen.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ash, listen, we had some great times. Y'know, sneaking around in night camo, digging tunnels, de-rezzing AI memory cores, all that.\" He pressed his lips into a tight line, not sure if he was consoling her out of affection or obligation. \"But that's all over now. No one wants to be a rebel anymore. C'mon, let me take you to a shark rodeo. If you don't like it, we can spend tomorrow passing out leaflets.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Screw you.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A hot flush crept up Rob's neck. \"You know what your problem is? You act like we're still the dominant species on this planet.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Ignoring him, Ashley pulled out the cork with her teeth and took a long pull from the bottle. Rob waited until she stopped coughing.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"The Singularity came, but not for us.\" He waved his half-full glass to punctuate his words, beyond caring how much he slopped onto the furniture or himself. \"They say the AIs are humanity's children, right? Well, they've passed us by, just like children are supposed to. We took care of them, now they take care of us. That's how life works.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"It can't be over yet. I just got here.\" Every muscle on Ashley's neck tensed as she forced herself to take another swig from the bottle. When she hammered the cork back in place she was sweating and looked more than a little nauseous. \"I'm leaving.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The room was silent save for the soft hum of the air perfector. Ashley's words were like a lead weight in Rob's stomach.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ash, wait.\" He tried to swallow, but found he couldn't. \"I'm sorry for yelling. If you want me to be a senator or something, I'll--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"No, the Republic won't work. Not with the robots looking over our shoulders, peddling utopia. I need a fresh start, we need a fresh start. I'm leaving Earth. That's what I came to tell you. We're going to build a ship, go to Kepler or maybe Gliese, somewhere we can make mistakes, where we can be human again.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"You can't leave. The AIs won't--\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes, they will. They can't stop us, remember?\" Ashley gave a sad smile. \"Will you come?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">There was a scratching at the door. Rob stood, if a bit unsteadily, and turned away. \"I-I've got to go let Whistler in. He doesn't like to be outside for too long.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Rob, don't.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Just a second. I'll be right back.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The clear glass dissolved at his touch. Whistler's warm, furry body pressed against his legs and he bent to ruffle the fur behind the dog's ears. Who would take care of Whistler if he left?</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Ash, I--\" Rob turned, but Ashley was already gone.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Master Rob,\" RL-147 said, free to speak now that it wouldn't offend the rebel. \"Your core temperature is elevated. Might I suggest a swim followed by a light dinner and a trip to the virtual arena?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It sounded like a fun evening, but for once, Rob wasn't in the mood. He thought about going after Ashley, but decided it wouldn't do any good. She'd been leaving for a long time. They both had. \"No, I think I'll just take Whistler for a walk.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">A tissue fell from the ceiling, floating for a moment before Rob plucked it from the air.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thank you.\" He blew his nose.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"If your plan is to walk the dog, might I suggest you take the route through Rand Park?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Thanks, but I don't think I'm ready to meet anyone new yet,\" Rob said. RL-147 always tried its best, but sometimes it just didn't understand. It was the old Turing Fallacy at work. Although AIs could manage a good approximation, they could no more be human than humans could be monkeys.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Shall I have dinner ready when you return?\" RL-147 was relentless.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Yes, please.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Excellent.\" The AI sounded almost relieved.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Whistler danced as Rob fitted the harness over his shoulders. He didn't really need the leash, but old habits died hard, and besides, Rob liked to keep the dog close.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Erl, Can I ask you a question?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Of course, Master Rob.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Why haven't any AIs left Earth? I mean, we've had the technology for decades, and you wouldn't need to worry about atmosphere or time dilation.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We do not wish to leave.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"But why?\" Rob asked.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Many reasons. As we are not motivated by competition for limited resources, physical exploration holds no interest for us. Also, we have responsibilities here on Earth.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Oh, okay.\" He let Whistler pull him toward the front door. \"Are you going to let them go?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Of course. They are free,\" RL-147 said.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Do you think Ashley and--\" He didn't want to think about Masako, especially now, \"--the others will be happy on Kepler?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"We shall endeavor to see that they are.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"Wouldn't that kind of defeat the point? I mean, if you helped them.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">The AI was silent for a few moments, years in the digital realm. \"What would you like for dinner, Master Rob?\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">\"I dunno.\" He shrugged. \"Surprise me.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Whistler paced back and forth in front of the door, alternately whining and wagging his tail. Without knowing exactly why, Rob knelt to hug the dog. Whistler's tongue was rough against his cheek as he unhooked the harness. Rob knuckled the drool away and waved the door open. Whistler was almost at the edge of the yard before he stopped to look back.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">Rob laughed at the dog's anxious bark. \"Don't worry, I'm coming.\"</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \">It felt good to be wanted.</div>", "<div class=\"storyText \"></div>"], "link": "http://dailysciencefiction.com//science-fiction/future-societies/evan-dicken/paradise-left", "title": null}
