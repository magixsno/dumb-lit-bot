# dumb-lit-bot

This is V0 of a really dumb AI that generates a litery story. There is a crawler that crawls for content, formats it into a JSON, then builds a simple state machine to generate a story from its seed stories.

Plans for V1 are under way!
- Add abstract structure to the data so that basic NLP/grammar rules can be applied
- Add structure for the general concepts of a story
- Add spellchecker/dictionary

Clean up plans:
- Make streamedlined so there aren't 3 different commands to run.
- Refactor the word-markov to have less hardcodedness.
